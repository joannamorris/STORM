  abstract = {We investigated the neural processes involved in on-line statistical learning and word segmentation. Auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded while participants were exposed to continuous, nonlinguistic auditory sequences, the elements of which were organized into ``tritone words'' that were sequenced in random order, with no silent spaces between them. After listening to three 6.6-min sessions of sequences, the participants performed a behavioral choice test, in which they were instructed to indicate the most familiar tone sequence in each test trial by pressing buttons. The participants were divided into three groups (high, middle, and low learners) based on their behavioral performance. The overall mean performance was 74.4\%, indicating that the tone sequence was segmented and that the participants learned the tone words statistically. Grand-averaged ERPs showed that word onset (initial tone) elicited the largest N100 and N400 in the early learning session of high learners, but in middle learners, the word-onset effect was elicited in a later session, and there was no effect in low learners. The N400 amplitudes significantly differed between the three learning sessions in the high- and middle-learner groups. The results suggest that the N400 effect indicates not only on-line word segmentation but also the degree of statistical learning. This study provides insight into the neural mechanisms underlying on-line statistical learning processes.},

We generate data from a realistic single-bound drift diffusion model with parameters informed by several different typical experiments in cognition.  We then examine the effects of log and reciprocal transformation on expected effect size, statistical power, and Type I error rates for conventional two-sample t-tests. One of the key elements of our setup is that RTs have a lower bound, called the shift, which is well above 0.  We closely examine the effect that different shifts have for the analyses. We conclude that logarithm and reciprocal transformation offer no gain in power or Type I error control.  In some typical cases, reciprocal transformations are detrimental as they lead to a lowering of power.},

  abstract = {This paper analyzes English symmetrical predicates such as collide and match. Its point of departure is an analysis of the concept `similar' from Tversky (1977) that appears to show that similarity is psychologically asymmetrical. One basis for this claim from Tversky is that the sentences North Korea is similar to Red China and Red China is similar to North Korea are assessed as differing in meaning by experimental subjects; this seems to imply that the symmetrical entailment (R x, y {$\leftrightarrow$} R y, x) fails for this concept. Five experiments are presented that show: (1) the apparent asymmetry of similar is reproduced for 20 predicates that are intuitively thought to be symmetrical, including equal and identical; (2) unique linguistic-interpretative properties hold for these symmetrical words, such as reciprocal interpretation when they appear intransitively, for example, North Korea and Red China are similar; (3) the asymmetrical interpretation of subject-complement constructions containing the symmetrical words is a consequence of general linguistic-interpretive principles. On the basis of the experimental findings, we offer an analysis of symmetrical predication. One major claim of the analysis is that symmetry is a property of lexical items and has no special syntax, that is, that John meets is semantically but not syntactically anomalous. A second claim is that the structural positioning of noun phrases in sentences containing symmetricals - rather than inherent semantic properties of the noun phrases themselves - sets their status as Figure and Ground (as described by Talmy, 1985) or Variant and Referent (as described by Tversky, 1977) in the comparison, even if the nouns are nonsense items. Finally, the behavior of symmetrical predicates is shown to vary as a function of their differing lexical class assignments and collateral semantic designations, such as activity versus state. Most generally, it is claimed that a deeper understanding of symmetrical terms comes from analyzing the semantics of syntactic structures in which they appear.},

  abstract = {This research examined the function within lexical access of the main morphemic units from which most Arabic words are assembled, namely roots and word patterns. The present study focused on the derivation of nouns, in particular, whether the lexical representation of Arabic words reflects their morphological structure and whether recognition of a word involves recognition of its morphological constituents. The morphology of Arabic language constitutes two main systems: inflectional morphology and derivational morphology. Inflectional morphology is used to express grammatical relations and derivational morphology deals with the formation of new words in language; it contains two types of word patterns: verbal and nominal. In this study, it was assumed that roots are lexical entities that can facilitate lexical access to a large cluster of words that derive from them, whereas word patterns are not lexical entities and have no role in access to words assembled by them. The lexical representations of the main morphemic units were examined in four experiments using skilled readers applying masked priming technique tasks: lexical decision and naming. The results indicated that previous exposure to a word sharing the same word pattern had no marked facilitating effect on lexical decision or on naming. The main conclusion of this study on the morphology of Arabic is that roots and word patterns have no essential role in word organisation in the mental lexicon. In addition, words in nominal pattern in derivational morphology are represented in their whole shape in the mental lexicon and each word has an independent representation.

In this study, we investigated substrates of VPL in the human brain by recording visual evoked potentials with high-density electroencephalography (hdEEG) before (Session 1) and after (Session 2) training on a texture discrimination task (TDT), with two full nights of sleep between sessions. We studied the following event-related potential (ERP) components: C1 (early sensory processing), P1 and N1 (later sensory processing, modulated by top-down spatial attention), and P3 (cognitive processing). Our results showed a significant decrease in C1 amplitude at Session 2 relative to Session 1 that was positively correlated with the magnitude of improvement in behavioral performance. Although we observed no significant changes in P1 amplitude with VPL, both N1 amplitude and latency were significantly decreased in Session 2. Moreover, the difference in N1 latency between Session 1 and Session 2 was negatively correlated with behavioral improvement. We also found a significant increase in P3 amplitude following training. Our results suggest that VPL of the TDT task may be due to plasticity in early visual cortical areas as well as changes in top-down attentional control and cognitive processing.},

We find that conventional metaphors differ from the literal condition with a slight amount of increased activation in the right inferior temporal gyrus. In addition, when the anomalous metaphor condition is compared with the literal condition, increased activation occurs bilaterally in the frontal and temporal gyri. Lastly, the comparison between the anomalous and conventional metaphor conditions shows bilateral activation in the middle frontal gyrus and the precentral gyrus, and right-hemisphere activation in the superior frontal gyrus. Left hemisphere activation is found in the inferior frontal gyrus and fusiform gyrus. The left hemisphere activation in the frontal and temporal gyri point to the recruitment of traditional language-based areas for anomalous metaphor sentences, while the right-hemisphere activation found suggests that remote associations are being formed. In short, our study supports the idea that metaphors are not a homogenous type of figurative language and that distinguishing between different types of metaphors will advance theories of language comprehension.},

  abstract = {Vector-space word representations have been very successful in recent years at improving performance across a variety of NLP tasks. However, common to most existing work, words are regarded as independent entities without any explicit relationship among morphologically related words being modeled. As a result, rare and complex words are often poorly estimated, and all unknown words are represented in a rather crude way using only one or a few vectors. This paper addresses this shortcoming by proposing a novel model that is capable of building representations for morphologically complex words from their morphemes. We combine recursive neural networks (RNNs), where each morpheme is a basic unit, with neural language models (NLMs) to consider contextual information in learning morphologically-aware word representations. Our learned models outperform existing word representations by a good margin on word sim- ilarity tasks across many datasets, including a new dataset we introduce focused on rare words to complement existing ones in an interesting way.}

We review these hypothesized functions and supporting empirical research and point to new directions for future theoretical efforts.

  abstract = {Prolactin is a polypeptide hormone that is responsible for lactation, breast development, and hundreds of other actions needed to maintain homeostasis. The chemical structures prolactin is similar to the structure of growth hormone and placental lactogen hormone. Together, they form the "prolactin/growth hormone/placental lactogen" family, which is characterized by a conserved helix bundle protein composition. All hormones in this family derive from a common ancestral gene. Prolactin is composed of 199 amino acids after the proteolytic cleavage of the signal peptide from the prolactin prohormone (pre-prolactin) and posttranslationally modified. It is common knowledge that the anterior pituitary synthesizes and secretes prolactin and dopamine-mediated hypothalamic regulation; however, the central nervous system, the immune system, the uterus, and the mammary glands all are capable of producing prolactin. Nipple stimulation, light, olfaction, and stress can all contribute to the initiation of prolactin synthesis in these tissues. Other factors that stimulate prolactin production include thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), estrogen (pregnancy),~and dopamine antagonists (antipsychotics). Males have characteristically low levels of prolactin. Abnormal elevation in males is suggestive of a potential underlying pathological process like a pituitary adenoma or a medication adverse effect, which warrants further evaluation. Prolactin is low in males and non-lactating non-pregnant females.[1][2][3][4][5]},

  abstract = {We examined sources of morphological variability in second language (L2) learners of Spanish whose native language (L1) is English, with a focus on L1-L2 similarity, morphological markedness, and knowledge type (receptive vs. expressive). Experiment 1 uses event-related potentials to examine noun-adjective number (present in L1) and gender agreement (absent in L1) in online sentence comprehension (receptive knowledge). For each feature, markedness was manipulated, such that half of the critical noun-adjective combinations were feminine (marked) and the other half were masculine; half were used in the plural (marked) and the other half were used in the singular. With this setup, we examined learners' potential overreliance on unmarked forms or 'defaults' (singular/masculine). Experiment 2 examines similar dependencies in spoken sentence production (expressive knowledge). Learners (n = 22) performed better with number than gender overall, but their brain responses to both features were qualitatively native-like (i.e., P600), even though gender was probed with nouns that do not provide strong distributional cues to gender. In addition, variability with gender agreement was better accounted for by lexical (as opposed to syntactic) aspects. Learners showed no advantage for comprehension over production, and no systematic evidence of reliance on morphological defaults, although their online processing was sensitive to markedness in a native-like manner. Overall, these results suggest that there is facilitation for L2 properties that exist in the L1 and that markedness impacts L2 processing, but in a native-like manner. These results also speak against proposals arguing that adult L2ers have deficits at the level of the morphology or the syntax. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Current morphological theory assumes that feature values, such as masculine and feminine or singular and plural, are asymmetrically represented. That is, one member of the opposition (e.g. feminine for gender, plural for number) is assumed to be marked, and the other one, unmarked. The present study examines how these asymmetries impact agreement resolution in Spanish. Agreement was manipulated between a noun acting as head of a relative clause and an adjective located inside the relative clause (e.g. catedral que parec\'ia inmensa ``cathedral that looked huge''). Half of the nouns were feminine (marked) and the other half, masculine (unmarked). Half of the nouns were used in the plural (marked) and the other half, in the singular (unmarked). Twenty-seven Spanish native speakers read 240 sentences while their brain activity was recorded with electroencephalography and performed a grammaticality judgment. Results showed that both number and gender violations elicited a central-posterior P600, a component associated with syntactic repair, and a late anterior negativity, argued to reflect working memory costs. Only the P600 was affected by markedness. It started earlier for violations where the mismatching feature was marked. Moreover, it was larger for errors where the mismatching feature was marked, although this amplitude modulation only emerged for number, possibly due to differences in how number and gender cues were realized (i.e. both masculine and feminine showed overt inflection, but singular was uninflected relative to plural). These results suggest that the parser is sensitive to markedness asymmetries in the course of online processing.},

However, evidence from patients with endocrine disorders suggests that biological factors during early development (e.g., levels of androgens) are influential. In this study, we found that vervet monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops sabaeus) show sex differences in toy preferences similar to those documented previously in children. The percent of contact time with toys typically preferred by boys (a car and a ball) was greater in male vervets (n=33) than in female vervets (n=30) (P{$<$}.05), whereas the percent of contact time with toys typically preferred by girls (a doll and a pot) was greater in female vervets than in male vervets (P{$<$}.01). In contrast, contact time with toys preferred equally by boys and girls (a picture book and a stuffed dog) was comparable in male and female vervets. The results suggest that sexually differentiated object preferences arose early in human evolution, prior to the emergence of a distinct hominid lineage. This implies that sexually dimorphic preferences for features (e.g., color, shape, movement) may have evolved from differential selection pressures based on the different behavioral roles of males and females, and that evolved object feature preferences may contribute to present day sexually dimorphic toy preferences in children.},

Even though some authors suggest that the null hypothesis is rarely true in practice (e.g., Meehl, 1990), F ratios {$<$} 1.0 are reported quite frequently in the literature. However, standard effect size statistics (e.g., Cohen's f) often yield positive values when F {$<$} 1.0, which appears to create confusion about the meaningfulness of effect size statistics when the null hypothesis may be true. Given the repeated emphasis on reporting effect sizes, it is shown that in the face of F {$<$} 1.0 it is misleading to only report sample effect size estimates as often recommended. Causes of F ratios {$<$} 1.0 are reviewed, illustrated by a short simulation study. The calculation and interpretation of corrected and uncorrected effect size statistics under these conditions are discussed. Computing adjusted measures of association strength and incorporating effect size confidence intervals are helpful in an effort to reduce confusion surrounding results when sample sizes are small.

Cross-modal inflectional priming facilitates regular verbs but not irregular verbs. Similar but morphologically unrelated words inhibit each other when presented cross-modally. Based on this effect for formbased inhibition, the authors interpret the regular/irregular verb priming asymmetry as a reflection of competition between orthographically similar verb forms which results in target inhibition. The authors found that orthographically dissimilar irregular verbs show strong priming facilitation. The authors account for this result in terms of a two-level lexicon in which irregular verb alternates have distinct form-level entries, but engage a common entry at an abstract morphological level of representation. In addition to serving as evidence concerning the representation of English verbal inflection, the findings from these experiments also set important limits on the claim that the cross-modal priming paradigm automatically circumvents form-related processing effects that are not morphological in character.

In certain conditions, priming effects were significantly greater with semantically transparent prefixed primes (e.g., rename-name) relative to the priming effects obtained with semantically opaque prefixed words (e.g., relate-late), even with very brief (40-msec) prime durations. With visual primes and auditory targets (cross-modal priming), significant facilitation was found in all related prime conditions, independent of whether or not primes were morphologically related to targets.

We show that mixing the color of adjacent letters of words does not result in facilitation of response times or error rates when the spatial-frequency pattern of a whole word is familiar. However, facilitation does occur when the spatial-frequency pattern of a whole word is not familiar. This pattern of results is not due to different luminance levels across the different-colored stimuli and the background because isoluminant displays were used. Also, the mixed-case, mixed-hue facilitation occurred when different display distances were used (Experiments 2 and 3), so this suggests that image normalization can adjust independently of object size differences. Finally, we show that this effect persists in both spaced and unspaced conditions (Experiment 4)\textemdash suggesting that inappropriate letter grouping by hue cannot account for these results. These data support a model of visual word recognition in which lower spatial frequencies are processed first in the more rapid MD stream. The slower ID and BD streams may process some lower spatial frequency information in addition to processing higher spatial frequency information, but these channels tend to lose the processing race to recognition unless the letter string is unfamiliar to the MD stream\textemdash as with mixed-case presentation.},

FLB includes a sensory-motor system, a conceptual-intentional system, and the computational mechanisms for recursion, providing the capacity to generate an infinite range of expressions from a finite set of elements. We hypothesize that FLN only includes recursion and is the only uniquely human component of the faculty of language. We further argue that FLN may have evolved for reasons other than language, hence comparative studies might look for evidence of such computations outside of the domain of communication (for example, number, navigation, and social relations).},

This study investigated whether 30 nonnative readers of English (compared to 30 monolingual English speakers), which in the case of the present study were native Filipino speakers, also make use of onset-rime units, particularly when some features of their native language appear to foster no awareness of such units. In two lexical decision experiments (n = 91), monosyllabic English words were presented, divided in between their first and second consonants (e.g., B LIND), at their onset-rime boundary (e.g., BL IND), or at their antibody boundary (e.g., BLI ND). Results indicated that the processes of infixation and reduplication did not affect the English word processing of native Filipino speakers. Rather, results for both native Filipino and native English speakers suggest that onsets composed of an "s /+ consonant' sequence (e.g., STAMP) are less cohesive than onsets comprised of a stop-liquid sequence (e.g., BLIND). It was concluded that not only may sonority constraints underlie onset cohesiveness, but that such phonetic properties may also be involved in visual word recognition.

Event-related potentials were recorded to all items allowing for comparisons of the N400 component to repetitions within- and between-languages as well as to words presented for the first time. Three important findings were observed in this sample of participants during relatively early stages of acquiring a second language. First, in the typical N400 window (300-500 ms), between-language repetition produced a smaller reduction in N400 amplitude than did within-language repetition. Second, the time-course of between-language repetition effects tended to be more extended in time and differed as a function of language with L2-L1 repetitions language producing larger priming effects early and L1-L2 repetitions producing larger priming effects later (during windows after the typical N400). Third, a greater negativity in the ERP waveforms was observed when the word on the directly preceding trial was from the other language.

Experiment 2 examined the role of both the BOSS frequency and the word frequency, also in a lexical-decision task. Syllable frequency was controlled. Both the BOSS frequency and the word frequency showed facilitatory effects. However, in Experiment 3A and 3B, a facilitatory effect of the root frequency (when controlling for BOSS frequency) and a null effect of BOSS frequency (when controlling for root frequency) were found, suggesting that the BOSS effect is in fact reflecting a morpheme effect.

Previous studies carried out in the macaque monkey found that lesions of the amygdala not only decrease emotional reactivity but also disrupt normal social interactions. We have re-investigated the relationship between amygdala lesions and social behavior in cohorts of mature and neonatal rhesus monkeys who were prepared with selective and complete bilateral ibotenic acid lesions of the amygdaloid complex. These animals display clear alterations in emotional and social behavior. We interpret these changes as due to a loss of the ability to evaluate environmental stimuli as potential threats. However, adult animals with bilateral lesions of the amygdala demonstrate near normal, and even increased, social interactions with conspecifics. Moreover, neonatal animals, prepared with amygdala lesions at 2 weeks of age, also demonstrate species typical social behaviors such as the generation of facial expressions, grooming and play behavior. These results argue against the idea that the amygdala is essential for the interpretation of social communication or for the expression of social behavior. Because it does appear to participate in the evaluation of the ``safety'' of social interactions, we believe that it does have a role in modulating the amount of social behavior in which an organism will participate. However, our current answer to the question posed in the title of this paper is no!},

We exploited a feature of several derived Italian words, that is, that they can be read in a ``morphologically transparent'' way or in a ``morphologically opaque'' way according to the sentence context to which they belong. This way, each target word was embedded in a sentence eliciting either its transparent or opaque interpretation. We analyzed whether the effect of stem frequency changes according to whether the (very same) word is read as a genuine derivation (transparent context) versus as a pseudoderived word (opaque context). Analysis of the first fixation durations revealed a stem-word frequency effect in both opaque and transparent contexts, thus showing that stems were accessed whether or not they contributed to word meaning, that is, word decomposition is indeed blind to semantics. However, while the stem-word frequency effect was facilitatory in the transparent context, it was inhibitory in the opaque context, thus showing an early involvement of semantic representations. This pattern of data is revealed by words with short suffixes. These results indicate that derived and pseudoderived words are segmented into their constituent morphemes also in natural reading; however, this blind-to-semantics process activates morpheme representations that are semantically connoted.

Adults use both evidential sources, as early as 200 ms after the offset of the pronoun (Arnold, Eisenband, Brown-Schmidt, \& Trueswell, 2000). We find that like adults, 3\textendash 5-year-old children use a pronoun's gender to guide their choice of a referent, and that they use it rapidly on-line. But unlike adults, they show little or no signs of a first-mentioned bias, either off-line or on-line.

  abstract = {The last 40 years have witnessed a growing interest in the mechanisms underlying the visual identification of complex words. A large amount of experimental data has been amassed, but although a growing number of studies are proposing explicit theoretical models for their data, no comprehensive theory has gained substantial agreement among scholars in the field. We believe that this is due, at least in part, to the presence of several controversial pieces of evidence in the literature and, consequently, to the lack of a well-defined set of experimental facts that any theory should be able to explain. With this review, we aim to delineate the state of the art in the research on the visual identification of complex words. By reviewing major empirical evidences in a number of different paradigms such as lexical decision, word naming, and masked and unmasked priming, we were able to identify a series of effects that we judge as reliable or that were consistently replicated in different experiments, along with some more controversial data, which we have tried to resolve and explain. We concentrated on behavioral and electrophysiological studies on inflected, derived, and compound words, so as to span over all types of complex words. The outcome of this work is an analytical summary of well-established facts on the most relevant morphological issues, such as regularity, morpheme position coding, family size, semantic transparency, morpheme frequency, suffix allomorphy, and productivity, morphological entropy, and morpho-orthographic parsing. In discussing this set of benchmark effects, we have drawn some methodological considerations on why contrasting evidence might have emerged, and have tried to delineate a target list for the construction of a new all-inclusive model of the visual identification of morphologically complex words.

It is striking, however, that perceptuo-motor decision making in humans and animals is rational. These results are consistent with perceptuo-motor strategies emerging in Bayesian brain theory that also appear in human data selection. People seem to have access, although limited, to unconscious generative models that can generalise to explain other verbal reasoning results. Error does not emerge predominantly from System 1, but rather seems to emerge from the later evolved System 2 that involves working memory and language. However language also sows the seeds of error correction by moving reasoning into the social domain. This reversal of roles suggests key areas of theoretical integration and new empirical directions.},

In Experiment 1, the frequency of the first and second morpheme was manipulated in compound words of low whole word frequency. Experiment 2 compared pairs of low frequency compounds with high and low frequency first morphemes but identical second morphemes that were embedded in the same sentence frames. The results showed significant effects of the frequency of both morphemes on gaze duration and total fixation time on the compound words. Regression analyses revealed an influence of whole word frequency on the same measures. The results suggest that morphemic constituents of compound words are activated in the course of retrieving the representation of the whole compound word. The fact that the frequency effects were not confined to fixations on the morphemic constituents themselves implies that saccadic eye movements are implemented before morphemic retrieval has been completed. The results highlight the importance of developing more precise models of the perceptual processes underlying reading and how they interact with the processes involved in lexical retrieval and comprehension.},

  abstract = {This experiment used the masked priming lexical decision task to address previous contradictory evidence about the relative strength of priming for (i) transparent pairs (e.g., worker WORK) which are morphologically and semantically related; (ii) opaque pairs (e.g., corner CORN) which appear to be morphological relatives but are not semantically related; and (iii) form pairs (e.g., turnip TURN) that are only orthographically related. The average data for 92 university students showed stronger priming effects for transparent than opaque or form pairs, due to a constant `headstart' for related relative to unrelated pairs across the RT distribution. However, these average effects were significantly modulated by individual differences in independent measures of spelling and vocabulary. A `semantic profile', defined by relatively higher vocabulary than spelling, was associated with robust priming for transparent pairs, particularly for slower responses, but little priming for opaque or form pairs. In contrast, individuals with an `orthographic profile' of relatively higher spelling than vocabulary showed sustained priming for opaque pairs that was at least as strong as for transparently related pairs. This evidence of systematic individual differences amongst skilled readers has important implications for theories of lexical representation and processing.},

The data for the whole sample showed facilitation from nonword primes, but inhibition from word primes. Linear mixed models including the individual difference measures showed that higher scores on a principal component that captured the shared variance among reading, spelling, and vocabulary were associated with both stronger inhibition from TL word primes and stronger facilitation from neighbor nonword primes. These findings are consistent with the lexical quality hypothesis of reading that predicts that skilled readers vary in the extent to which they have developed precisely specified orthographic representations.

Neural stem and progenitor cells are classified into several classes based on the different location of mitosis (apical or basal) and polarity features (bipolar, monopolar and non-polar). The polarized architecture of stem cells is linked to the asymmetric localization of proteins, mRNAs and organelles, such as the centrosome and the Golgi apparatus (GA). Polarity affects stem cell function and allows stem cells to integrate environmental cues from distinct niches in the developing cerebral cortex. The crucial role of polarity in neural stem and progenitor cells is highlighted by the fact that impairment of cell polarity is linked to neurodevelopmental disorders such as Down syndrome, Fragile X syndrome, autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and schizophrenia.},

  abstract = {The central argument presented in this paper is that statistical learning (SL) is an ability comprised of multiple components that operate largely implicitly. Components relating to the stimulus encoding, retention and abstraction required for SL may include, but are not limited to, certain types of attention, processing speed and memory. It is likely that individuals vary in terms of the efficiency of these underlying components, and in patterns of connectivity among these components, and that SL tasks differ from one another in how they draw on certain underlying components more than others. This theoretical framework is of value because it can assist in gaining a clearer understanding of how SL is linked with individual differences in complex mental activities such as language processing. Variability in language processing across individuals is of central concern to researchers interested in child development, including those interested in neurodevelopmental disorders where language can be affected such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD). This paper discusses the link between SL and individual differences in language processing in the context of age-related changes in SL during infancy and childhood, and whether SL is affected in ASD. Viewing SL as a multi-component ability may help to explain divergent findings from previous empirical research in these areas and guide the design of future studies.

This tutorial also shows how triangulation of methods and cross-linguistic research can be used to gain insight. Method The impossibility of conveying explicitly all of the regularities that children need to acquire in a deep orthography, such as English, can be demonstrated by examining lesser-known probabilistic orthographic cues to lexical stress. Detection of these kinds of cues likely occurs via a type of implicit learning known as statistical learning (SL). The first part of the tutorial focuses on these points. Next, studies exploring how individual differences in the capacity for SL relate to variability in word reading accuracy in the general population are discussed. A brief overview of research linking impaired SL and dyslexia is also provided. The final part of the tutorial focuses on how we might supplement explicit literacy instruction with implicit learning methods and emphasizes the value of testing the efficacy of new techniques in the classroom. The basic and applied research reviewed here includes corpus analyses, behavioral testing, computational modeling, and classroom-based research. Although some of these methods are not commonly used in clinical research, the depth and breadth of this body of work provide a compelling case for why reading can be thought of as SL and how this view can inform practice. Conclusion Implicit methods that draw on the principles of SL can supplement the much-needed explicit instruction that helps children learn to read. This synergy of methods has the potential to spark innovative practices in literacy instruction and remediation provided by educators and clinicians to support typical learners and those with developmental disabilities.},

The stimulus materials include exemplars of prototype categories (sport, vehicle, fruit, vegetable) previously studied by others, and also exemplars of supposedly well-defined categories (odd number, even number, female, and plane geometry figure). Experiment I, using these materials, replicated the exemplar rating experiment of Rosch (1973). It showed that both the well-defined and prototypic categories yield graded responses, the supposed hall-mark of a family resemblance structure. Experiment II, using the same sorts of stimulus materials, replicated a verification-time paradigm, also from Rosch (1973). Again, the finding was that both well-defined and prototypic categories yielded results previously interpreted to support a family-resemblance description of those categories, with faster verification times for prototypical exemplars of each category. In Experiment III, new subjects were asked outright whether membership in the category of fruit, odd number, etc., is a matter of degree, or is not, and then these subjects were rerun in the Experiment I paradigm. Though subjects judged odd number, etc., to be well-defined, they provided graded responses to all categories once again. These findings highlight interpretive difficulties for the experimental literature on this topic. Part I of the discussion first outlines a dual theory of concepts and their identification procedures that seems to organize these outcomes. But Part II of the discussion argues that feature theories are too impoverished to describe mental categories, in general.},

That study showed that sex differences in behavior, and by extension in the brain, were permanently sexually differentiated by testosterone, a testicular secretion, during an early critical period of development. The study placed the brain together in a class with other major sexually dimorphic tissues (external genitalia and genital tracts), and proposed an integrated hormonal theory of sexual differentiation for all of these non-gonadal tissues. Since 1959, the organizational\textendash activational theory has been amended but survives as a central concept that explains many sex differences in phenotype, in diverse tissues and at all levels of analysis from the molecular to the behavioral. In the last two decades, however, sex differences have been found that are not explained by such gonadal hormonal effects, but rather because of the primary action of genes encoded on the sex chromosomes. To integrate the classic organizational and activational effects with the more recently discovered sex chromosome effects, we propose a unified theory of sexual differentiation that applies to all mammalian tissues.},

Although English spelling uses the Roman alphabet and is thus largely phonographic, it also encodes non-phonological distinctions such as those among homophonic words (e.g., pair, pare, pear). We review evidence that English spelling is to some extent morphographic at the level of suffixes: some suffixes (e.g. -s and -ed) have a single constant spelling (\guilsinglleft -s\guilsinglright{} and \guilsinglleft -ed\guilsinglright ), despite the fact that they vary in phonological realization (-s is realized as [z], [s], or [{$\Elzschwa$}z], depending on the preceding segment); while other suffixes (e.g. -ic) are spelled differently from homophonous word-final phonological sequences (e.g. \guilsinglleft relic\guilsinglright{} vs. \guilsinglleft relick\guilsinglright ). We explore the implications of our research for psycholinguistic findings on morphological processing of written English, with a special focus on 'affix stripping' processes. Psycholinguistic research has largely assumed the straightforward linguistic validity of morphographic spelling, without appreciating either its typologically unusual nature or the subtle and complex relation that it bears to morphology, phonology, and semantics.},

  abstract = {Starting from the hypothesis that printed word identification initially involves the parallel mapping of visual features onto location-specific letter identities, we analyze the type of information that would be involved in optimally mapping this location-specific orthographic code onto a location-invariant lexical code. We assume that some intermediate level of coding exists between individual letters and whole words, and that this involves the representation of letter combinations. We then investigate the nature of this intermediate level of coding given the constraints of optimality. This intermediate level of coding is expected to compress data while retaining as much information as possible about word identity. Information conveyed by letters is a function of how much they constrain word identity and how visible they are. Optimization of this coding is a combination of minimizing resources (using the most compact representations) and maximizing information. We show that in a large proportion of cases, non-contiguous letter sequences contain more information than contiguous sequences, while at the same time requiring less precise coding. Moreover, we found that the best predictor of human performance in orthographic priming experiments was within-word ranking of conditional probabilities, rather than average conditional probabilities. We conclude that from an optimality perspective, readers learn to select certain contiguous and non-contiguous letter combinations as information that provides the best cue to word identity.},

In this it can offer guiding flexible structure and in-road for teachers to design STEAM-based lessons, and to incorporate as an integrated aspect of students' STEAM learning. I discuss an example of an elementary Spanish teacher, who, as a student in a graduate-level design thinking and education course, used design thinking to design an interdisciplinary STEAM project for her students. This example illustrates how design thinking can guide teachers' STEAM curriculum design, and be interwoven into elements of STEAM curricula, to open up more interdisciplinary, creative and project-based opportunities.},

Here we sought to track the time course of this discrimination and to determine how orthographic information\textendash letter position and letter identity\textendash is computed during reading. We used a go/no-go lexical decision task while recording event-related potentials (ERPs). Subjects were presented with single words (go trials) and pseudowords (no-go trials), which varied in orthographic conformation, presenting either a double consonant frequently doubled (i.e., "ss") or never doubled (i.e., "zz") (identity factor); and a position of the double consonant was which either legal or illegal (position factor), in a 2 x 2 factorial design. Words and pseudowords clearly differed as early as 230 msec. At this latency, ERP waveforms were modulated both by the identity and by the position of letters: The fronto-central no-go N2 was the smallest in amplitude and peaked the earliest to pseudowords presenting both an illegal double-letter position and an identity never encountered. At this stage, the two factors showed additive effects, suggesting an independent coding. The factors of identity and position of double letters interacted much later in the process, at the P3 level, around 300-400 msec on frontal and central sites, in line with the lexical decision data obtained in the behavioral study. Overall, these results show that the speed of lexical decision may depend on orthographic information coded independently by the identity and position of letters in a word.

Phonemes and the distinctive features that they comprise constitute the basic building blocks from which higher-level linguistic representations, such as words and sentences, are formed. Although the neural structures underlying phonemic representations have been well studied, there is considerable debate regarding frontal-motor cortical contributions to speech as well as the extent of lateralization of phonological representations within auditory cortex. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and multivoxel pattern analysis to investigate the distributed patterns of activation that are associated with the categorical and perceptual similarity structure of 16 consonant exemplars in the English language used in Miller and Nicely's (1955) classic study of acoustic confusability. Participants performed an incidental task while listening to phonemes in the MRI scanner. Neural activity in bilateral anterior superior temporal gyrus and supratemporal plane was correlated with the first two components derived from a multidimensional scaling analysis of a behaviorally derived confusability matrix. We further showed that neural representations corresponding to the categorical features of voicing, manner of articulation, and place of articulation were widely distributed throughout bilateral primary, secondary, and association areas of the superior temporal cortex, but not motor cortex. Although classification of phonological features was generally bilateral, we found that multivariate pattern information was moderately stronger in the left compared with the right hemisphere for place but not for voicing or manner of articulation.},

However, two right hemisphere patients were described with a clear dissociation between impaired derivational morphology and preserved inflectional processing. A recent fMRI experiment confirmed the involvement of right hemispheric areas in derivational processing and also suggested that the right basal ganglia contribute to deriving nouns from verbs. The present investigation was aimed at further demonstrating the role of the right hemisphere in derivational processing. Nine right brain damaged subjects were asked to perform different derivational tasks. Five out of nine subjects confirmed the previous data. They selectively failed only in deriving nouns from verbs (i.e. to observe \textrightarrow{} observation), mostly substituting the derived noun with a frequent inflectional suffix of the verb paradigm (i.e. observed instead of observation). Lesion subtraction analysis revealed that the caudate nucleus and the corona radiata, are the subcortical structures associated with the morphological deficit. Anatomical commonalities were found between lesion site in these patients and activations in healthy subjects. An account of these results in terms of a distributed bi-hemispheric neural network in complex language tasks is offered.

There is some empirical support for the hypothesis that these sublexical access units are functionally involved in the process of word recognition. These studies focus on the role of prefixes as access units in visual word recognition. Adult readers and children were presented a lexical decision task using polysyllabic word and nonword items. Prefix Frequency (high/low) and Quality (true/pseudo prefix ratio) were manipulated. Evidence was found for differential use of prefix information in both groups. Characteristic difference patterns between skilled and less skilled readers are discussed. It is concluded that the information accessed by prefixes is semantically combined with the subsequent word stem (root). Characteristics of the prefix plus stem combination largely determine speed of access to the complex word item processed. The results are compared to those of A.

Children provide a strong test of a causal role for language in ToM development. Many deaf children have significantly delayed language acquisition, but they have age-appropriate nonverbal intelligence and active sociability. In this chapter the author first summarizes the findings of previous studies of ToM development in deaf children. These provide suggestive evidence that language acquisition is a fundamental contributor to children's mastery of reasoning about false beliefs. However, there are a number of flaws in the earlier studies, varying from small sample sizes to weaknesses in the measurement of ToM reasoning and especially of language acquisition in the deaf children. The author therefore describes the findings of a more comprehensive study of the relationship between language and false-belief reasoning in deaf children that was designed to eliminate these weaknesses. Two studies in particular are detailed in this chapter: one which studies the relationship between language and false-belief understanding in oral and ASL signing deaf children, and the second which studies teasing apart the relative effects of executive functioning and language on the mastery of false-belief reasoning by oral deaf children. The results of the first study argue for a strong causal role of language in the development of a representational ToM. The second study confirms the results of Study 1 that processing of false-complement clauses with communication verbs is the primary language predictor of the mastery of false-belief reasoning in the standard ToM tasks for deaf children.},

Lenneberg hypothesized that maturational processes similar to those that govern sensory and motor development may also constrain capabilities for normal language acquisition. Our goal, using a bilingual model, was to investigate the hypothesis that maturational constraints may have different effects upon the development of the functional specializations of distinct sub within language. Subjects were 61 adult Chinese/English bilinguals who were exposed to English at different points in development: 1\textendash 3, 4\textendash 6, 7\textendash 10, 11\textendash 13, and after 16 years of age. Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) and behavioral responses were obtained as subjects read sentences that included semantic anomalies, three types of syntactic violations (phrase structure, specificity constraint, and subjacency constraint), and their controls. The accuracy in judging the grammaticality for the different types of syntactic rules and their associated ERPs was affected by delays in second language exposure as short as 1\textendash 3 years. By comparison the N400 response and the judgment accuracies in detecting semantic anomalies were altered only in subjects who were exposed to English after 11\textendash 13 and 16 years of age, respectively. Further, the type of changes occurring in ERPs with delays in exposure were qualitatively different for semantic and syntactic processing. All groups displayed a significant N400 effect in response to semantic anomalies, however, the peak latencies of the N400 elicited in bilinguals who were exposed to English between 11\textendash 13 and {$>$}16 years occurred later, suggesting a slight slowing in processing. For syntactic processing. the ERP differences associated with delays in exposure to English were observed in the morphology and distribution of components. Our findings are consistent w- th the view that maturational changes significantly constrain the development of the neural systems that are relevant for language and, further, that subsystems specialized for processing different aspects of language display different sensitive periods.},

  abstract = {(from the chapter) The importance of language for theory of mind, and more specifically for belief ascription, has become increasingly apparent during recent years. Language is important in many ways for many reasons, as the chapters in this volume clearly show. In this chapter the authors discuss the question of why language matters for the development of false-belief understanding in particular. "Language" is a broad term-different structural aspects as well as different functions fall under the scope of the term, and therefore it is important to first be precise about the aspects of language to which this chapter is referring. In the introduction (Astington \& Baird, this volume, chapter 1), the authors make two orthogonal distinctions. The first is a functional distinction, between language as an intra-individual representational system, on the one hand, and language as an inter-individual communication system, on the other. The second distinction is made at a structural level between language in general and mentalistic language in particular. With reference to the first distinction, the focus in this chapter is on language as an internal, representational system that can support the development of false-belief understanding. With reference to the second, the authors focus on the role of language in general until the final section of the chapter, when attention is shifted to mentalistic language in particular.

The neuronal devices underlying words and concepts are distributed neuronal assemblies reaching into sensory and motor systems of the cortex and, at the cognitive level, information binding in such widely dispersed circuits is mirrored by the sensorimotor grounding of form and meaning of symbols. Recent years have seen the emergence of evidence for similar brain embodiment of syntax. Neurophysiological studies have accumulated support for the linguistic notion of abstract combinatorial rules manifest as functionally discrete neuronal assemblies. Concepts immanent to the theory of abstract automata could be grounded in observations from modern neuroscience, so that it became possible to model abstract pushdown storage \textendash{} which is critical for building linguistic tree structure representations \textendash{} as ordered dynamics of memory circuits in the brain. At the same time, neurocomputational research showed how sequence detectors already known from animal brains can be neuronally linked so that they merge into larger functionally discrete units, thereby underpinning abstract rule representations that syntactically bind lexicosemantic classes of morphemes and words into larger meaningful constituents. Specific predictions of brain-based grammar models could be confirmed by neurophysiological and brain imaging experiments using MEG, EEG and fMRI. Neuroscience and neurocomputational research offering perspectives on understanding abstract linguistic mechanisms in terms of neuronal circuits and their interactions therefore point programmatic new ways to future theory-guided experimental investigation of the brain basis of grammar.},

In this volume, these researchers give their answers to the fundamental question: Why does language matter for theory of mind? Theory of mind requires awareness of other peoples mental states-beliefs, desires, intentions, and emotions-that are revealed largely through conversation. As their language skills develop, children are able to take part in conversation, and it is this experience that allows them to acquire concepts of mental states and to master the syntax for representing them. For theory of mind to develop, children need both the social environment that provides the input and their own cognitive resources that make use of it. This volume is a state-of-the-art account of the latest conceptual and empirical advances in children's theory of mind. The contributors consider the links between theory of mind and language from both communicational and representational perspectives because language serves both of these different functions-that is, social communication in conversation and internal, verbal representation. They also present research from a variety of populations-typically developing children, children with autism, and deaf children. The result is a kaleidoscopic view of the complexity of the relationship between language and theory of mind that provides a variety of answers to the question of why language matters for theory of mind.

  abstract = {The human brain is often considered to be the most cognitively capable among mammalian brains and to be much larger than expected for a mammal of our body size. Although the number of neurons is generally assumed to be a determinant of computational power, and despite the widespread quotes that the human brain contains 100 billion neurons and ten times more glial cells, the absolute number of neurons and glial cells in the human brain remains unknown. Here we determine these numbers by using the isotropic fractionator and compare them with the expected values for a human-sized primate. We find that the adult male human brain contains on average 86.1 {$\pm$} 8.1 billion NeuN-positive cells (``neurons'') and 84.6 {$\pm$} 9.8 billion NeuN-negative (``nonneuronal'') cells. With only 19\% of all neurons located in the cerebral cortex, greater cortical size (representing 82\% of total brain mass) in humans compared with other primates does not reflect an increased relative number of cortical neurons. The ratios between glial cells and neurons in the human brain structures are similar to those found in other primates, and their numbers of cells match those expected for a primate of human proportions. These findings challenge the common view that humans stand out from other primates in their brain composition and indicate that, with regard to numbers of neuronal and nonneuronal cells, the human brain is an isometrically scaled-up primate brain.

Moreover, changes in both schooling and intelligence influence variations in economic outcomes. Although any single study of the interdependency of these 3 variables can be criticized on the grounds that the data are correlational (and consequently are open to alternative interpretations) when viewed together, the evidence for their linked causality is quite convincing: Each increment in school attendance appears to convey significant increases not only in economic and social returns but also in psychometric intelligence. Thus, the value of schooling appears to extend beyond simply schooling's direct effect on income. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

  abstract = {According to the Procedural Deficit Hypothesis (PDH), abnormalities of brain structures underlying procedural memory largely explain the language deficits in children with specific language impairment (SLI). These abnormalities are posited to result in core deficits of procedural memory, which in turn explain the grammar problems in the disorder. The abnormalities are also likely to lead to problems with other, non-procedural functions, such as working memory, that rely at least partly on the affected brain structures. In contrast, declarative memory is expected to remain largely intact, and should play an important compensatory role for grammar. These claims were tested by examining measures of working, declarative and procedural memory in 51 children with SLI and 51 matched typically-developing (TD) children (mean age 10). Working memory was assessed with the Working Memory Test Battery for Children, declarative memory with the Children's Memory Scale, and procedural memory with a visuo-spatial Serial Reaction Time task. As compared to the TD children, the children with SLI were impaired at procedural memory, even when holding working memory constant. In contrast, they were spared at declarative memory for visual information, and at declarative memory in the verbal domain after controlling for working memory and language. Visuo-spatial short-term memory was intact, whereas verbal working memory was impaired, even when language deficits were held constant. Correlation analyses showed neither visuo-spatial nor verbal working memory was associated with either lexical or grammatical abilities in either the SLI or TD children. Declarative memory correlated with lexical abilities in both groups of children. Finally, grammatical abilities were associated with procedural memory in the TD children, but with declarative memory in the children with SLI. These findings replicate and extend previous studies of working, declarative and procedural memory in SLI. Overall, we suggest that the evidence largely supports the predictions of the PDH.},

It is well known that word formation processes are subject to various syntagmatic conditions. Booij (1977) develops a typology of such conditioning factors, distinguishing between rule-specific and rule-independent restrictions on the one hand, and between restrictions pertaining to phonological, stratal and syntactic characteristics on the other.1 The r\^ole of pardigmatic factors is discussed in van Marie (1985). He points out that (roughly) synonymous affixes tend to select their base words from complementary domains. Hence they can be analyzed as mutually affecting their respective degrees of productivity.},

In English, such facilitation could be due to morphological relatedness, or to some combination of the orthographic and semantic relatedness characteristic of derivationally related words. The authors report 2 sets of visual priming experiments in which the morphological, semantic, and orthographic relationships between primes and targets are varied in three SOA conditions. 72 Ss participated in Exp 1 and 74 participated in Exp 2. Ss were aged 18\textendash 40 yrs. Results showed that morphological structure plays a significant role in the early visual recognition of English words that is independent of both semantic and orthographic relatedness.

  abstract = {The event-related potential (ERP) technique, in which neural responses to specific events are extracted from the EEG, provides a powerful noninvasive tool for exploring the human brain. This volume describes practical methods for ERP research along with the underlying theoretical rationale. It offers researchers and students an essential guide to designing, conducting, and analyzing ERP experiments. This second edition has been completely updated, with additional material, new chapters, and more accessible explanations. Freely available supplementary material, including several online-only chapters, offer expanded or advanced treatment of selected topics. The first half of the book presents essential background information, describing the origins of ERPs, the nature of ERP components, and the design of ERP experiments. The second half of the book offers a detailed treatment of the main steps involved in conducting ERP experiments, covering such topics as recording the EEG, filtering the EEG and ERP waveforms, and quantifying amplitudes and latencies. Throughout, the emphasis is on rigorous experimental design and relatively simple analyses. New material in the second edition includes entire chapters devoted to components, artifacts, measuring amplitudes and latencies, and statistical analysis; updated coverage of recording technologies; concrete examples of experimental design; and many more figures. Online chapters cover such topics as overlap, localization, writing and reviewing ERP papers, and setting up and running an ERP lab.},

  abstract = {Talk of linguistic universals has given cognitive scientists the impression that languages are all built to a common pattern. In fact, there are vanishingly few universals of language in the direct sense that all languages exhibit them. Instead, diversity can be found at almost every level of linguistic organization. This fundamentally changes the object of enquiry from a cognitive science perspective. This target article summarizes decades of cross-linguistic work by typologists and descriptive linguists, showing just how few and unprofound the universal characteristics of language are, once we honestly confront the diversity offered to us by the world's 6,000 to 8,000 languages. After surveying the various uses of ``universal,'' we illustrate the ways languages vary radically in sound, meaning, and syntactic organization, and then we examine in more detail the core grammatical machinery of recursion, constituency, and grammatical relations. Although there are significant recurrent patterns in organization, these are better explained as stable engineering solutions satisfying multiple design constraints, reflecting both cultural-historical factors and the constraints of human cognition.Linguistic diversity then becomes the crucial datum for cognitive science: we are the only species with a communication system that is fundamentally variable at all levels. Recognizing the true extent of structural diversity in human language opens up exciting new research directions for cognitive scientists, offering thousands of different natural experiments given by different languages, with new opportunities for dialogue with biological paradigms concerned with change and diversity, and confronting us with the extraordinary plasticity of the highest human skills.},

The authors demonstrate that whereas unmasked stem-homograph primes elicit inhibitory effects, masked primes elicit facilitation relative to both orthographic and unrelated controls. It was hypothesized that this inhibition is a (sub)component of the selection process that is engaged when a fully ambiguous lexical stimulus (here the inflectional stem of a stem homograph) must be assigned a unique interpretation in order to afford conscious perception/recognition. The authors' analysis highlights the interdependency between lexical parsing and the inhibition mechanisms observed during word recognition.

  abstract = {One critical aspect of language acquisition is the development of a lexicon that associates sounds and meanings; but developing a lexicon first requires that the infant segment utterances into individual words. How might the infant begin this process? The present study was designed to examine the potential role that sensitivity to predominant stress patterns of words might play in lexical development. In English, by far the majority of words have stressed (strong) initial syllables. Experiment 1 of our study demonstrated that by 9 months of age American infants listen significantly longer to words with strong/weak stress patterns than to words with weak/strong stress patterns. However, Experiment 2 showed that no significant preferences for the predominant stress pattern appear with 6-month-old infants, which suggests that the preference develops as a result of increasing familiarity with the prosodic features of the native language. In a third experiment, 9-month-olds showed a preference for strong/weak patterns even when the speech input was low-pass filtered, which suggests that their preference is specifically for the prosodic structure of the words. Together the results suggest that attention to predominant stress patterns in the native language may form an important part of the infant's process of developing a lexicon.},

They were found to vary widely on a measure of nervous system (NS) sensitivity recommended by A. N. Vasiler (1960). Ss were contrasted on their mean press and release RTs to 4 tones, ranging from soft (55 db) to loud (100 db), with the expectation that some would be able to maintain a parallel separation of press and release RT gradients across all intensity levels, and others would show convergence or overlap of the gradients at higher intensities. Contrary to expectation, girls did not have weaker or more sensitive NSs than boys, although girls rated themselves as less tolerant of intense stimuli. Significantly more of Ss diagnosed as hyperactive had weaker NSs. Boys also participated in a blind crossover study contrasting placebo and methylphenidate effects; the prescribing physician, who was not informed of the child's NS classification, adjusted the dosage levels so that Ss with weaker NS were titrated at higher dosage levels than those with stronger NSs. J. A. Gray (1964) suggested an explanation of the paradox (that the weak NS requires a more intense stimulus than the strong to reach the threshold of concentration, whereas for other thresholds the strong requires a more intense stimulus than the weak). Gray's theory was supported by the finding that Ss typed as weak did not show as great facilitation in RT with reward. (23 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2002 APA, all rights reserved).},

Previous studies held that structural conditions on coreference work as interpretive filters that impose exceptionless limits on which antecedent candidates can be evaluated by subsequent, content-based processes. These experiments instead support an interactive-parallel-constraint model, in which multiple weighted constraints (including constraints on binding) simultaneously influence the net activation of a candidate during preselection stages of antecedent evaluation. Accordingly, structurally inaccessible candidates can interfere with antecedent selection if they are both prominent in focus structure and gender-number compatible with the pronoun or anaphor.

Following the principles of inflection, the distribution of these allomorphs is determined by competition. This view is in sharp contrast to the long-standing assumption that derivational suffixes convey not only morpho-syntactic, but also semantic information. In this article, a detailed analysis of two functionally similar English suffixes, -ness and -ity, will show that the distributionalist view is too vague as it stands because it misses subtle but significant semantic differences between these suffixes, which result from their historical development. On the basis of doublets such as ethnicness versus ethnicity, or sincereness versus sincerity it will be argued that -ness and -ity are not in complementary distribution, but select different domains of their adjectival bases.

Among the available functional imaging techniques, MEG and EEG uniquely have temporal resolutions below 100 ms. This temporal precision allows us to explore the timing of basic neural processes at the level of cell assemblies. MEG/EEG source localization draws on a wide range of signal processing techniques including digital filtering, three-dimensional image analysis, array signal processing, image modeling and reconstruction, and, blind source separation and phase synchrony estimation. We describe the underlying models currently used in MEG/EEG source estimation and describe the various signal processing steps required to compute these sources. In particular we describe methods for computing the forward fields for known source distributions and parametric and imaging-based approaches to the inverse problem.},

  abstract = {The initial process of identifying words from spoken language and the detection of more subtle regularities underlying their structure are mandatory processes for language acquisition. Little is known about the cognitive mechanisms that allow us to extract these two types of information and their specific time-course of acquisition following initial contact with a new language. We report time-related electrophysiological changes that occurred while participants learned an artificial language. These changes strongly correlated with the discovery of the structural rules embedded in the words. These changes were clearly different from those related to word learning and occurred during the first minutes of exposition. There is a functional distinction in the nature of the electrophysiological signals during acquisition: an increase in negativity (N400) in the central electrodes is related to word-learning and development of a frontal positivity (P2) is related to rule-learning. In addition, the results of an online implicit and a post-learning test indicate that, once the rules of the language have been acquired, new words following the rule are processed as words of the language. By contrast, new words violating the rule induce syntax-related electrophysiological responses when inserted online in the stream (an early frontal negativity followed by a late posterior positivity) and clear lexical effects when presented in isolation (N400 modulation). The present study provides direct evidence suggesting that the mechanisms to extract words and structural dependencies from continuous speech are functionally segregated. When these mechanisms are engaged, the electrophysiological marker associated with rule-learning appears very quickly, during the earliest phases of exposition to a new language.},

The authors advocate viewing mental-state concepts as emerging in the context of social and linguistic interaction. The purpose of this chapter is to pursue this issue as a specific case of Gentner and colleagues' (e.g., Gentner \& Medina, 1998) general proposal that language is a catalyst for abstraction in part because it serves as an aid to analogical reasoning and inductive inference. The authors' hypothesis is that language invites one to compare people's behavior across distinct action scenarios, thereby helping to highlight commonalities, foster attention to relevant differences, and promote inferences about non-obvious sources of commonality and difference. The authors delve into the process of mentalistic abstraction, wherein ideas are formed to explain notions such as belief, desire, and intention. The authors provide a far-from-comprehensive sketch of Gentner et al's conceptualization of analogical reasoning, followed by brief coverage of findings indicating that language facilitates analogical reasoning. With this background established, the chapter turns to applying these ideas to the case of present interest: construction of mentalistic concepts.

  abstract = {A pronoun pattern that is common in both spoken and written English is some form of they with singular, generic antecedents, as in, ?Everyone was so pleased with themselves.? This article addresses the question of how long such a pattern has been in the language and how a pattern that clearly violates number agreement could become so ubiquitous. An examination of recent scholarship as well as the historical record reveals that the origins of this usage rest in the fourteenth century and that its frequency has increased since then. Using current theories of agreement, the author presents a hypothesis for how and when this pattern could have entered the language. Further examination of the historical record supports the hypothesis that loss of grammatical gender in the thirteenth century was crucial for the introduction of generic they into the language.}

In this article, I develop the view that learning to appreciate morphological relationships may be a vital part of acquiring a direct mapping between printed words and their meanings, represented in the ventral brain pathway of the reading network. I show that morphology provides an important degree of regularity across this mapping in English, and suggest that this regularity is directly associated with irregularity in the mapping between spelling and sound. I further show that while children in primary school display explicit knowledge of morphological relationships, there is scant evidence they show the rapid morphological analysis of printed words that skilled readers exhibit. These findings suggest that the acquisition of long-term morphological knowledge may be associated with the ongoing development of reading expertise. Implications for reading instruction are discussed.},

  abstract = {Two auditory lexical decision experiments document for morphologically complex words two points at which the probability of a target word given the evidence shifts dramatically. The first point is reached when morphologically unrelated competitors are no longer compatible with the evidence. Adapting terminology from Marslen-Wilson (1984), we refer to this as the word's initial uniqueness point (UP1). The second point is the complex uniqueness point (CUP) introduced by Balling and Baayen (2008), at which morphologically related competitors become incompatible with the input. Later initial as well as complex uniqueness points predict longer response latencies. We argue that the effects of these uniqueness points arise due to the large surprisal (Levy, 2008) carried by the phonemes at these uniqueness points, and provide independent evidence that how cumulative surprisal builds up in the course of the word co-determines response latencies. The presence of effects of surprisal, both at the initial uniqueness point of complex words, and cumulatively throughout the word, challenges the Shortlist B model of Norris and McQueen (2008), and suggests that a Bayesian approach to auditory comprehension requires complementation from information theory in order to do justice to the cognitive cost of updating probability distributions over lexical candidates.

Although the same set of words was used in each task, the relationship of the lexical variables to RT varied significantly with the task within which the words were embedded. The effect of word frequency was minimal in the category verification task, whereas it was significantly larger in the pronunciation task and significantly larger yet in the lexical decision task. It is argued that decision processes having little to do with lexical access accentuate the word-frequency effect in the lexical decision task and that results from this task have questionable value in testing the assumption that word frequency orders the lexicon, thereby affecting time to access the mental lexicon. A simple 2-stage model is outlined to account for the role of word frequency and other variables in lexical decision. The model is applied to the results of the reported experiments and some of the findings in other studies of lexical decision and pronunciation.

Word recognition research is central to notions regarding different levels/codes of analysis in language processing, attention, and memory. The lexical unit is ideally suited for such work because words can be analyzed at many different levels\textemdash for example, features, letters, graphemes, phonemes, morphemes, and semantics. Word recognition research is also central in the development of theories of automatic and attentional processes. Part of the reason for this emphasis is the natural relation between the development of reading skills and the development of automaticity. One can see the extra impetus from education circles regarding the development of word recognition skills. Moreover, the notion that the aspect of word recognition has been automatized and is no longer under the conscious control of the reader has historically provided some of the major fuel for arguments regarding self-encapsulated linguistic processing modules. The issue of how attentional control signals might modulate processes involved in word recognition has received renewed interest recently, and hence, notions of automaticity and modularity have been reevaluated.},

We review simple procedures for capturing characteristics of underlying RT distributions and show how such procedures have recently been useful to better understand effects from standard cognitive experimental paradigms and individual differences in performance. These well-studied procedures for understanding RT distributions indicate that effects in means can be produced by (a) shifts of RT distributions, (b) stretching of slow tails of RT distributions, or (c) some combination. Importantly, effects in means can actually be obscured by opposing influences on the modal and tail portions of RT distributions. Such disparate patterns demand novel theoretical interpretations.},

Yet most of these studies test metaphor in isolation while in natural conversation metaphors do not come out of the blue but embedded in linguistic and extra-linguistic context. This study aimed at assessing the role of context in the metaphor comprehension process. We recorded EEG activity while participants were presented with metaphors and equivalent literal expressions in a minimal context (Experiment 1) and in a supportive context where the word expressing the ground between the metaphor's topic and vehicle was made explicit (Experiment 2). The N400 effect was visible only in minimal context, whereas the P600 was visible both in the absence and in the presence of contextual cues. These findings suggest that the N400 observed for metaphor is related to contextual aspects, possibly indexing contextual expectations on upcoming words that guide lexical access and retrieval, while the P600 seems to reflect truly pragmatic interpretative processes needed to make sense of a metaphor and derive the speaker's meaning, also in the presence of contextual cues. In sum, previous information in the linguistic context biases towards a metaphorical interpretation but does not suppress interpretative pragmatic mechanisms to establish the intended meaning.},

The congenial fence was that anthropology studied what people think and psychology studied how people think. Recent research, however, shows that content and process cannot be neatly segregated, because cultural differences in what people think affect how people think. To achieve a deeper understanding of the relation between process and content, research must integrate the methodological insights from both anthropology and psychology. We review previous research and describe new studies in the domain of folk biology which examine the cognitive consequences of different conceptualizations of nature and the place of humans within it. The focus is on cultural differences in framework theories (epistemological orientations) among Native Americans (Menominee) and European American children and adults living in close proximity in rural Wisconsin. Our results show that epistemological orientations affect memory organization, ecological reasoning, and the perceived role of humans in nature. This research also demonstrates that cultural differences in framework theories have implications for understanding intergroup conflict over natural resources and are relevant to efforts to improve science learning, especially among Native American children.},

Four infant monkeys were reared for nearly a year in a separate room where the illumination came from only monochromatic lights. After extensive training, they were able to perform color matching. However, their judgment of color similarity was different from that of normal animals. Furthermore, they had severe deficits in color constancy; their color vision was very much wavelength dominated, so they could not compensate for the changes in wavelength composition.

In those instances where a student evidences a meaningful understanding but still disbelieves, we further propose that the appropriate goal is for students to believe that the theory in question affords the best current scientific account of the relevant phenomena based on the available empirical evidence. Third, we evaluate instructional procedures for addressing the issues of knowledge, belief, and understanding recommended by recent authors before providing our own suggestions to teachers that we hope will be both more philosophically sound and more effective in the classroom.},

  abstract = {The present study investigated whether morphological processing in reading is influenced by the orthographic consistency of a language or its morphological complexity. Developing readers in Grade 3 and skilled adult readers participated in a reading aloud task in four alphabetic orthographies (English, French, German, Italian), which differ in terms of both orthographic consistency and morphological complexity. English is the least consistent, in terms of its spelling-to-sound relationships, as well as the most morphologically sparse, compared to the other three. Two opposing hypotheses were formulated. If orthographic consistency modulated the use of morphology in reading, readers of English should show more robust morphological processing than readers of the other three languages, because morphological units increase the reliability of spelling-to-sound mappings in the English language. In contrast, if the use of morphology in reading depended on the morphological complexity of a language, readers of French, German, and Italian should process morphological units in printed letter strings more efficiently than readers of English. Both developing and skilled readers of English showed greater morphological processing than readers of the other three languages. These results support the idea that the orthographic consistency of a language, rather than its morphological complexity, influences the extent to which morphology is used during reading. We explain our findings within the remit of extant theories of reading acquisition and outline their theoretical and educational implications.},

In Experiment 2, participants for whom an elderly stereotype was primed walked more slowly down the hallway when leaving the experiment than did control participants, consistent with the content of that stereotype. In Experiment 3, participants for whom the African American stereotype was primed subliminally reacted with more hostility to a vexatious request of the experimenter.

Evidence suggesting that 6-year-olds form underlying representations composed of morphophonemic segments was obtained by asking children to imitate complex words, omit specified portions, and discuss the meaning of the resulting word parts. Trial items represent a variety of instances in which phonetic forms differ from underlying representations. Although language-advanced first graders produced stronger evidence suggesting morphophonemic segments than language-delayed age-mates, and young adults supplied stronger evidence than either first-grade group; strength of evidence leads to the interpretation that even language-delayed 6-year-olds form morphophonemic segments. Differences in performance between groups probably derive from differences in metalinguistic abilities and linguistic experience rather than from differences in units of phonological processing.},

Data indicated that (a) behavioral accuracy was almost perfect for all the experimental tasks, and (b) although P200 and N400 ERP components were elicited in the experimental tasks, the latencies of those components were significantly longer and their amplitudes significantly higher in the phonological task. Variations in vowel information had no effect on word recognition in either type of task. The results suggest that among skilled readers of Hebrew, phonological processing during word recognition may be more effortful and may demand greater cognitive resources than orthographic processing. Furthermore, the additional phonological information represented in vowels appears to contribute little to word recognition in this population.

This predicts distinct EEG patterns elicited by words of these 2 classes. To test this prediction, content and function words, together with matched pseudowords, were presented in a lexical decision task (where subjects had to decide whether stimuli were meaningful words or not). Evoked potentials were recorded from 17 electrodes 12 of which were located in close vicinity of the perisylvian cortices. Already 160 msec post stimulus onset, substantial differences in activity patterns distinguish the 2 vocabulary classes. A hemisphere by word class interaction revealed interhemispheric differences for function words but not for content words. Potentials evoked by function words were more negative over the left hemisphere compared to the right. These results evidence that brain mechanisms underlying function and content word processing are different. The following explanation of the data is proposed: content words correspond to neuronal assemblies equally distributed over both hemispheres, while assemblies corresponding to function words are strongly lateralized to the left hemisphere and primarily located in the perisylvian region.},

However, many researchers do not seem to appreciate how random effects structures affect the generalizability of an analysis. Here, we argue that researchers using LMEMs for confirmatory hypothesis testing should minimally adhere to the standards that have been in place for many decades. Through theoretical arguments and Monte Carlo simulation, we show that LMEMs generalize best when they include the maximal random effects structure justified by the design. The generalization performance of LMEMs including data-driven random effects structures strongly depends upon modeling criteria and sample size, yielding reasonable results on moderately-sized samples when conservative criteria are used, but with little or no power advantage over maximal models. Finally, random-intercepts-only LMEMs used on within-subjects and/or within-items data from populations where subjects and/or items vary in their sensitivity to experimental manipulations always generalize worse than separate F1 and F2 tests, and in many cases, even worse than F1 alone. Maximal LMEMs should be the `gold standard' for confirmatory hypothesis testing in psycholinguistics and beyond.},

The relative lack of theorists in the field of design education studies leaves unquestioned the relevance of conventional practices of design education that are premised on only tangentially relevant Art, Science and Information Technology models. There is a gap in design education development regarding how to mediate ecological concerns with techno-scientific imperatives. Environmental education researchers can influence this new field by challenging existing approaches to design education with particular attention to the ways design either contributes to or hinders the development of a sustainable society. In order to enter this discussion with environmental education researchers we identify three ecological issues faced by designers and design educators, here we pay particular attention to Industrial Design. The question for this paper is, can environmental education researchers offer advice to the design education area that may help us develop ecologically sustainable design-based programs. The newness of ecological concerns in the design research and design education areas means that we have a great deal to learn. If environmental education researchers are able to assist us with our reflections on designing curricula that in turn encourages a more ecologically aware design profession then this would be a worthwhile contribution to design practice in Australia, and indeed the world.},

From a recording of a mother speaking to her child, matched samples were constructed by inserting pauses either at clause boundaries or at within-clause locations. The infants oriented longer to the samples segmented at the clause boundary. A second experiment confirmed that these preferences depended on where the pauses were inserted in the samples. These findings have important implications for understanding how language is learnable. The prelinguistic infant apparently possesses the means to detect important units such as clauses, within which grammatical rules apply.},

It is noted that agrammatic aphasics do not exhibit a normal pattern of verb production; their spontaneous speech is said to lack verbs, and the verbs that are produced lack inflection. Dutch is a so-called verb-second language in which the finite verb in the matrix clause is in the second position and nonfinite verbs are in the final position. Problems with verbs in Dutch agrammatic spontaneous speech are thought to be restricted to finite lexical verbs. The experiment evaluated whether these problems are caused by a morphological deficit or a syntactic deficit. 20 Ss (aged 27-78) participated. Results show that a syntactic deficit is more likely; Ss produced finite verbs in the base-generated position significantly better than finite verbs that have been moved to the second position. The authors conclude that in Dutch, a verb-second language, agrammatic aphasics demonstrate specific problems with moved finite verbs. This syntactic problem affects not only the proportion of finite verbs but also the diversity of the verbs and, hence, communicative contents.

We show that failure to converge typically is not due to a suboptimal estimation algorithm, but is a consequence of attempting to fit a model that is too complex to be properly supported by the data, irrespective of whether estimation is based on maximum likelihood or on Bayesian hierarchical modeling with uninformative or weakly informative priors. Importantly, even under convergence, overparameterization may lead to uninterpretable models. We provide diagnostic tools for detecting overparameterization and guiding model simplification.},

  abstract = {This study showed that V1bR knockout dams show decreased maternal aggression compared to wildtype dams, and investigated the involvement of the receptor subtype in brain-regions known to be involved in maternal behaviour, including the medial preoptic area, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the paraventricular nucleus. Adequate maternal behaviour offers the best chance for the offspring to survive to maturity. This pro-social behaviour is known to be regulated by the nonapeptide arginine-vasopressin (AVP) amongst other peptidergic and non-peptidergic systems in rodents as well as in humans. Most research regarding the AVP system in maternal behaviour has focussed on the peptide itself and its V1a receptor (V1aR), and revealed a pivotal involvement in the regulation of different aspects of maternal behaviour. In addition, the involvement of AVP and its V1aR was investigated in the animal model of rats selected for extremes in anxiety-related behaviour. Highly anxious dams (HAB) have a single nucleotide polymorphism in the AVP promoter-region, resulting in increased expression and release of AVP. Regarding the phenotype, HAB dams show a hyper-protective mothering style in contrast to dams selected for low anxiety-related behaviour (LAB), which only provide a low amount of maternal behaviour. Since the maternal phenotype of HAB and LAB dams can be partly reversed by blockade or infusion of V1aR or synthetic AVP, respectively, these rats provide a good model to observe the behavioural consequences after pharmacological manipulation of the AVP system on maternal behaviour. The influence of V1b receptors (V1bR) on mediating maternal behaviour has only been investigated in a single study in V1bR knockout mice to date. This study showed that V1bR knockout dams show decreased maternal aggression compared to wildtype dams. Therefore, I aimed to investigate in more detail the role of central V1bR on the maternal repertoire via acute central application of V1bR agonist and antagonist during lactation in non-selected rats (Chapter 2) as well as in the animal model of rats selected for extremes in anxiety-related behaviour (Chapter 3). Although the V1bR is widely distributed within the brain, I aimed to investigate the involvement of the receptor subtype in brain-regions known to be involved in maternal behaviour, including the medial preoptic area (MPOA), the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) via acute local infusion of V1bR antagonist. In addition, I determined whether endogenous V1bR protein and/or mRNA expression differ in lactation within these brain regions (Chapter 4 -5). Further, in a pilot study co-expression of AVP and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) immune-reactivity in the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT) in lactating rats was observed. Since mice with a 30 \% decrease of GnRH neurons show impaired pup retrieval, and the co-localization suggests an interaction with the AVP system known to be involved in maternal behaviour, I was interested in the influence of the GnRH and the interconnected kisspeptin system in the regulation of maternal behaviour in rodents (Chapter 6). To investigate my aims I used a variety of cellular, molecular and behavioural approaches like quantitative real-time PCR, western blotting, central or local acute pharmacological manipulation of V1bR, GnRH receptors or kisspeptin receptors followed by observations of maternal care, maternal motivation to retrieve pups, maternal aggression and anxiety-related behaviour. In this thesis I showed that central blockade of V1bR in non-selected rats impaired maternal care but did not affect maternal motivation, maternal aggression or anxiety-related behaviour. V1bR manipulation in HAB and LAB dams had no effect on any maternal behaviour. When investigating the role of V1bR in specific brain regions, I could show that blockade of V1bR within the MPOA increased maternal motivation whereas within the BNST maternal aggression, more precisely pup-directed behaviour, was decreased. Additionally, V1bR blockade in both brain regions decreased nursing, but only under stress conditions. Interestingly, in the PVN only V1aR, but not V1bR blockade decreased nursing under non-stress conditions in addition to maternal anxiety.  Thus, both V1R subtypes seem to be involved in the regulation of maternal behaviour in a brain region-dependent and context-specific manner, thereby acting exclusively, as complement or as counterpart of the other receptor subtype. Interestingly, this was not associated with alterations in mRNA or protein expression in any brain-region, suggesting that either transport of the receptor-subtype to the membrane, signal transduction or agonist sensitivity may be altered in lactation, which remains to be investigated. Regarding the involvement of GnRH and kisspeptin in the regulation of maternal behaviour, blocking GnRH decreased maternal aggression, whereas kisspeptin receptor (GPR54) blockade resulted in impaired maternal care, in a dose-dependent manner. These results provide evidence, that the GnRH and kisspeptin system are not only involved in reproduction, but also in various aspects of maternal behaviour. Further investigation of their role, especially in maternal brain circuits, is essentially required. In conclusion, the presence of V1bR in brain regions involved in maternal behaviour are mandatory in lactating rodents to show adequate maternal behaviour, especially in stressful situations. Further, maternal behaviour is regulated by a variety of hormones acting centrally within the brain like oxytocin and AVP, whereby hormones like GnRH and kisspeptin, thought to be mainly responsible in reproduction also influence maternal behaviour.  Taken all these results into account I could provide further knowledge of the impact of central hormonal systems on the complexity of regulatory mechanism in maternal behaviour.},

  abstract = {In the macaque monkey striate (primary visual) cortex, the grouping of cells into ocular dominance and orientation columns leads to the prediction of highly specific spatial patterns of cellular activity in response to stimulation by lines through one or both eyes. In the pesent paper these paterns have been examined by the 2-deoxyuglucose autoradiographic method developed by Sokoloff and his group (Kennedy et al, '76). An anesthetized monkey was given an injection of 14C 2-deoxyglucose and then visually stimulated for 45 minues with a large array of moving vertical stripes, with both eyes open. The 14C autoradiographs of striate cortex showed vertical bands of label extending through the full cortical thickness. Layer I was at most only lightly labelled, and layers IV b and VI wee the most dense. Layer IV c (the site of terminations of most geniculate afferents) was labelled uniformly along its length, as expected from the lack of orientation specificity of units recorded in that leyer. In the other layers the pattern seen in tangential sections was complex, consisting of swirling stripes with many bifurcations and blind endings, but with occasional more regular regions whee the stripes wee roughly parallel. Interstripe distance was rather constant, at 570 {$\mu$}m. Ocular dominance columns were examined in this same monkey, in the same region, by injecting one eye with 3H-proline two weeks before the deoxyglucose experiment, and preparing a second set of autoradiographs of the sections after prolonged washing to remove the 14C-deoxyglucose. As seen in tangential sections through layer IV c, these columns had the usual stripe-like form, with a period of 770 {$\mu$}m, but were simpler in their pattern than the orientation stripes, with fewer bifurcations and less swirling. A comparison of the two sets of columns in the same area showed many intersections, but no strict or consistent relationships: angles of intersection showed a distribution that was not obviously different from that expected for any two randomly superimposed sets of lines. Another monkey was stimulated with vertical stripes, but with only one eye open. Deoxyglucose autoradiographs of tangential sections showed regular uniform rows of label in layer IV c, with all the characteristic features of eye dominance columns. In the layers above and below IV c the rows in tangential view were broken up into regularly spaced patches of label, presumably representing aggregations of cells responsive to vertically oriented stimuli. The patches showed no consistent alignment across the ocular dominance rows, and indeed no such tendency would be expected, considering the complexity of the orientation columns. This pattern of labelling is again predicted from and confirms the previous physiological studies.},

Much empirical evidence indicates that, although this knowledge can be used fairly flexibly, it is functionally organized in `semantic memory' along a number of dimensions, including similarity and association. Here, we review recent findings using an electrophysiological brain component, the N400, that reveal the nature and timing of semantic memory use during language comprehension. These findings show that the organization of semantic memory has an inherent impact on sentence processing. The left hemisphere, in particular, seems to capitalize on the organization of semantic memory to pre-activate the meaning of forthcoming words, even if this strategy fails at times. In addition, these electrophysiological results support a view of memory in which world knowledge is distributed across multiple, plastic-yet-structured, largely modality-specific processing areas, and in which meaning is an emergent, temporally extended process, influenced by experience, context, and the nature of the brain itself.},

This preference was also orientation-dependent: newborns looked longer at upright displays than upside-down displays (Exp. 3).

Two variants of psi are precognition (conscious cognitive awareness) and premonition (affective apprehension) of a future event that could not otherwise be anticipated through any known inferential process. Precognition and premonition are themselves special cases of a more general phenomenon: the anomalous retroactive influence of some future event on an individual's current responses, whether those responses are conscious or nonconscious, cognitive or affective. This article reports 9 experiments, involving more than 1,000 participants, that test for retroactive influence by ``time-reversing'' well-established psychological effects so that the individual's responses are obtained before the putatively causal stimulus events occur. Data are presented for 4 time-reversed effects: precognitive approach to erotic stimuli and precognitive avoidance of negative stimuli; retroactive priming; retroactive habituation; and retroactive facilitation of recall. The mean effect size (d) in psi performance across all 9 experiments was 0.22, and all but one of the experiments yielded statistically significant results. The individual-difference variable of stimulus seeking, a component of extraversion, was significantly correlated with psi performance in 5 of the experiments, with participants who scored above the midpoint on a scale of stimulus seeking achieving a mean effect size of 0.43. Skepticism about psi, issues of replication, and theories of psi are also discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

Exploring the commonalities of artificial systems, including economic systems, the business firm, artificial intelligence, complex engineering projects, and social plans, Simon argues that designed systems are a valid field of study, and he proposes a science of design. For this third edition, originally published in 1996, Simon added new material that takes into account advances in cognitive psychology and the science of design while confirming and extending the book's basic thesis: that a physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means for intelligent action.Simon won the Nobel Prize for Economics in 1978 for his research into the decision-making process within economic organizations and the Turing Award (considered by some the computer science equivalent to the Nobel) with Allen Newell in 1975 for contributions to artificial intelligence, the psychology of human cognition, and list processing.

  abstract = {Theoretical results suggest that in order to learn the kind of com- plicated functions that can represent high-level abstractions (e.g., in vision, language, and other AI-level tasks), one may need deep architec- tures. Deep architectures are composed of multiple levels of non-linear operations, such as in neural nets with many hidden layers or in com- plicated propositional formulae re-using many sub-formulae. Searching the parameter space of deep architectures is a difficult task, but learning algorithms such as those for Deep Belief Networks have recently been proposed to tackle this problem with notable success, beating the state- of-the-art in certain areas. This monograph discusses the motivations and principles regarding learning algorithms for deep architectures, in particular those exploiting as building blocks unsupervised learning of single-layer models such as Restricted Boltzmann Machines, used to construct deeper models such as Deep Belief Networks.}

The word association hypothesis proposes that a direct association is established between words in the two languages. During second-language acquisition, that association is used to understand and produce words in the second language by retrieving a word in the first language. The concept mediation hypothesis proposes that the only connection between the two languages is via an underlying, amodal conceptual system, one to which pictured objects also have access. The hypotheses make different predictions about the time to name pictures in the second language relative to the time to translate first-language words into the second language. Two experiments are reported, one with proficient Chinese\textemdash English bilinguals and the second with nonfluent English\textemdash French bilinguals (American high school students). Subjects read words aloud, named pictures, and translated words; one Chinese\textemdash English group categorized pictures and words. The results were consistent with the concept mediation hypothesis and contradicted predictions of the word association hypothesis. There was no evidence for a direct association between words in the two languages in either bilingual group.},

  abstract = {The effect of morphological repetition at lag 0 and at lag 15 on lexical decision was investigated in Hebrew with three types of relation between prime and target. In the semantic-plus-morphological condition (SM), the prime and the target in each pair were two semantically related derivatives of the same root. In the ``pure morphological'' condition (M), the prime and the target derived from the same root, but their semantic association was very low, or nonexistent. In the semantic priming condition (S), primes and targets were semantically associated but were not morphologically related. The pure semantic relationship produced a significant facilitation at lag 0 that disappeared completely at lag 15. The pure morphological relation produced (smaller but) significant facilitation at lag 0 that was not attenuated at lag 15. When prime and target were semantically as well as morphologically related, the facilitation at lag 0 was similar to semantic priming, whereas at lag 15 it was similar to the pure morphological effect. Significant repetition effects at both lags were also found with non-words that shared the same (nonsensical) root and differed with respect to real derivational affixes. The differential time course for facilitation due to semantic and morphological relatedness suggests distinct underlying processes, although at lag 0 it is possible that semantic relatedness may augment the morphological repetition effect. Morphological repetition probably facilitates the retrieval of lexical information that, under certain circumstances, is necessary for lexical decision.},

Traditional models suggest that children use morphology relatively late in their spelling careers and that the end-point of development lies in rule-based performance. In contrast, we show that (a) children are sensitive to the role of morphemes in determining spelling at a young age and (b) they do not rely (at least exclusively) on rules. We discuss the features that may account for discrepancies between studies demonstrating late versus early use of morphology and we examine the processes that children might rely on in their learning, specifically statistical learning of intra- and inter-word regularities and retrieval of item-specific representations. This proposal provides a potential explanation for how children learn about the representation of morphology in print.},

Repetition facilitated performance in all tasks and for all stimulus types. However, ERPs were strongly affected by repetition only in lexical decision, face recognition, and letter search, when relatively long stimulus analysis and decision making processes were required. The ERP repetition effect consisted of a significant increase in P300 amplitude and a shortening of its latency. Repetition also resulted in the attenuation of a negative component that was tentatively identified as N400. These results suggest that immediate repetition facilitates stimulus identification and eliminates the need for stimulus analysis processes including access to semantic memory while making categorical decisions. While both factors affected RT, ERPs were modulated primarily by the elimination of the need to access to semantic memory and by the consequent speeding of categorical decision processes.

Nineteen subjects listened passively to or discriminated actively between sequences of bisyllabic Dutch words, which started with either a weak or a strong syllable. Weak-initial words, which constitute 12\% of the Dutch lexicon, evoked more negativity than strong-initial words in the interval between P2 and N400 components of the auditory event-related potential. This negativity was denoted as N325. The N325 was larger during stress discrimination than during passive listening. N325 was also larger when a weak-initial word followed a sequence of strong-initial words than when it followed words with the same stress pattern. The latter difference was larger for listeners who performed well on stress discrimination. It was concluded that the N325 is probably a manifestation of the extraction of metrical stress from the acoustic signal and its transformation into task requirements.},

  abstract = {The aim of the present study was to examine the time course and scalp distribution of electrophysiological manifestations of the visual word recognition mechanism. Event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by visually presented lists of words were recorded while subjects were involved in a series of oddball tasks. The distinction between the designated target and nontarget stimuli was manipulated to induce a different level of processing in each session (visual, phonological/phonetic, phonological/lexical, and semantic). The ERPs of main interest in this study were those elicited by nontarget stimuli. In the visual task the targets were twice as big as the nontargets. Words, pseudowords, strings of consonants, strings of alphanumeric symbols, and strings of forms elicited a sharp negative peak at 170 msec (N170); their distribution was limited to the occipito-temporal sites. For the left hemisphere electrode sites, the N170 was larger for orthographic than for nonorthographic stimuli and vice versa for the right hemisphere. The ERPs elicited by all orthographic stimuli formed a clearly distinct cluster that was different from the ERPs elicited by nonorthographic stimuli. In the phonological/phonetic decision task the targets were words and pseudowords rhyming with the French word vitrail, whereas the nontargets were words, pseudowords, and strings of consonants that did not rhyme with vitrail. The most conspicuous potential was a negative peak at 320 msec, which was similarly elicited by pronounceable stimuli but not by nonpronounceable stimuli. The N320 was bilaterally distributed over the middle temporal lobe and was significantly larger over the left than over the right hemisphere. In the phonological/lexical processing task we compared the ERPs elicited by strings of consonants (among which words were selected), pseudowords (among which words were selected), and by words (among which pseudowords were selected). The most conspicu- us potential in these tasks was a negative potential peaking at 350 msec (N350) elicited by phonologically legal but not by phonologically illegal stimuli. The distribution of the N350 was similar to that of the N320, but it was broader and including temporo-parietal areas that were not activated in the ``rhyme'' task. Finally, in the semantic task the targets were abstract words, and the nontargets were concrete words, pseudowords, and strings of consonants. The negative potential in this task peaked at 450 msec. Unlike the lexical decision, the negative peak in this task significantly distinguished not only between phonologically legal and illegal words but also between meaningful (words) and meaningless (pseudowords) phonologically legal structures. The distribution of the N450 included the areas activated in the lexical decision task but also areas in the fronto-central regions. The present data corroborated the functional neuro-anatomy of word recognition systems suggested by other neuroimaging methods and described their timecourse, supporting a cascade-type process that involves different but interconnected neural modules, each responsible for a different level of processing word-related information.},

  abstract = {ERPs were recorded during a lexical decision task in order to investigate electrophysiological concomitants of semantic priming. The stimuli were 240 words and 240 nonwords presented one per trial at a fixed intertrial interval. Subjects were required to classify each stimulus as a word or nonword by pressing one of two response buttons. ERPs were recorded from 14 scalp locations, the right suborbital ridge, and the left earlobe, all referred to a balanced non-cephalic reference. RT and error data confirmed that semantic priming occurred under the conditions employed: primed words (those preceded by a semantically related word) were identified as words faster and more accurately than were unprimed words (those preceded by semantically unrelated words or nonwords). ERPs for all stimulus types were characterized by a large positivity peaking between 550 and 650 msec, preceded by a negative-going deflection peaking at approximately 400 msec. ERPs for primed and unprimed words were shown to differ significantly, diverging 200\textendash 250 msec following stimulus onset, reaching a maximum near the peak of the negative-going deflection at 400 msec. These differences were observed at locations over both hemispheres and were maximal in the centroparietal region. Although P300 latency differences between primed and unprimed words were also obtained, the priming effect on ERPs at shorter latencies could not be explained solely by P300 latency effects. Possible relationships between these ERP concomitants of semantic priming and P300, N200, and N400 were discussed.},

The concept of the etymon as the cornerstone of Semitic morphology is in sharp contrast to the well-accepted view that considers the 3-consonantal root to be the kernel and major carrier of meaning in Hebrew and Arabic words. Boudelaa and Marslen-Wilson were not concerned with the linguistic status of the etymon theory, but focused on the psychological reality of the etymon. Boudelaa and Marslen-Wilson also report a set of experiments exploring cross-modality and masked priming effects between words sharing the etymon, with or without a semantic relation between primes and targets. In addition to the theoretical and empirical complications that emerge assuming that etymons are primary morphemic units in Arabic, the present authors are also puzzled by some aspects of the data reported by Boudelaa and Marslen-Wilson.

The present research explored the use of sequence encoders in models of monosyllabic and bisyllabic word naming. Performance in these models is comparable to other models in terms of word and pseudoword naming accuracy, as well as accounting for naming latency phenomena. Although the models do not address all naming phenomena, the results suggest that sequence encoders can learn orthographic and phonological representations, making it easier to create models that scale up to larger vocabularies, while accounting for behavioural data.},

In contrast, the inflection of irregular sounding nouns is strongly sensitive to their similarity to stored irregular tokens. Exp 2 (16 Ss) establishes the generality of the regular default for novel words that are phonologically idiosyncratic. Exp 3 (39 Ss) demonstrates that Hebrew speakers assign the default regular inflection to borrowings and names that are identical to existing irregular nouns. The existence of default inflection in Hebrew is incompatible with the distributional asymmetry hypothesis. Our findings also lend no support for a type-frequency account.

A question thus arises as to how the recognition system codes for morpheme position within words, given that it needs to distinguish morphological anagrams like overhang and hangover. The present study focused specifically on whether the recognition of suffixes occurs in a position-specific fashion. Experiments 1 and 2 revealed that morphologically complex nonwords (gasful ) are rejected more slowly than orthographic controls (gasfil ) but that the same interference effect is not present when the morphemic constituents are reversed ( fulgas vs. filgas). Experiment 3 went further in demonstrating that reversing the morphemes within words (e.g., nesskind) does not yield morpheme interference effects against orthographic controls (e.g., nusskind). These results strongly suggest that suffix identification is position specific, which imposes important constraints on the further development of models of morphological processing.},

In a first experiment children spelled to dictation regular words and words with unpredictable spelling that contained either a high- or a low-frequency (i.e., typical or atypical) sound-spelling mappings. Children with dyslexia were found to rely on probabilistic cues in writing stimuli with unpredictable spelling to a greater extent than typically developing children. The difficulties of children with dyslexia on words with unpredictable spelling were limited to those containing atypical mappings. In a second experiment children spelled new stimuli, i.e., pseudowords, containing phonological segments with unpredictable mappings. The interaction between lexical knowledge and reliance on probabilistic cues was examined through a lexical priming paradigm in which pseudowords were primed by words containing related typical or atypical sound-to-spelling mappings. In spelling pseudowords children with dyslexia showed sensitivity to probabilistic cues in the phoneme-to-grapheme mapping but lexical priming effects were also found, although to a smaller extent than in typically developing readers. The results suggest that children with dyslexia have a limited orthographic lexicon but are able to extract regularities from the orthographic system and rely on probabilistic cues in spelling words and pseudowords.},

Subjects (Ss) in Exps 1 and 2 were 20 native Hebrew speakers. Ss in Exp 3 were 24 native Hebrews speakers. Results show that these hallmarks of regularity may be found whether or not the plural form preserves the stem faithfully: People apply the regular suffix to novel nouns that do not resemble existing nouns and to names that sound like irregular nouns, regardless of whether the stem is ordinarily preserved in the plural of that family of nouns. When they pluralize names, they do not apply the stem changes that are found in their homophonous nouns, replicating an effect found in English and German. These findings show that the distinction between regular and irregular phenomena cannot be reduced to differences in the kinds of phonological changes associated with those phenomena in English. Instead, regularity and irregularity must be distinguished in terms of the kinds of mental computations that effect them: symbolic operations versus memorized idiosyncrasies.

Three experiments with 60 Ss examined whether this phonological constraint affects performance in a lexical decision task. The rejection of nonwords generated from novel roots with root-initial gemination was significantly faster than roots with final gemination controls. The emergence of this asymmetry regardless of the position of geminates in the word implicates a constraint on root, rather than simply word structure. Results further indicate that speakers are sensitive to the structure of geminate bigrams. Nonwords formed from roots with final gemination were significantly more difficult to reject than foils generated from frequency-matched no gemination controls. Speakers are thus sensitive to the identity of geminates and constrain their location in the root.

The study of tense-aspect morphology has been the focus of many descriptive and pedagogical accounts of language.

The development of temporality is amenable to study through production data. This field of inquiry is dominated by learner-generated texts.

If linguistic constraints appeal to variables, rather than instances, then they should generalize to any representable novel instance, including instances that fall beyond the phonological space of a language. This prediction was tested by investigating a constraint on the structure of Hebrew roots. Hebrew frequently exhibits geminates in its roots, but it strictly constraints their location: geminates are frequent at the end of the root, but rare at its beginning. Symbolic accounts capture the ban on root-initial geminates as XXY, where X and Y are variables that stand for any two distinct consonants. If the constraint on root structure appeals to the identity of abstract variables, then speakers should be able to extend it to root geminates with foreign phonemes, including phonemes with foreign feature values. Findings are presented from three experiments supporting this prediction. These results suggest that a complete account of linguistic processing must incorporate mechanisms for generalization outside the representational space of trained items. Mentally-represented variables would allow speakers to make such generalizations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2002 APA, all rights reserved).},

However, it is not as arbitrary as one might conclude. Investigating the spelling of four derivational suffixes, we show that the spelling of English suffixes is quite consistent. Homophonous endings of morphologically simple words are spelled differently, keeping the suffix spelling distinct (cf. e.g. \&lt;nervous vs. \&lt;service/*\&lt;servous). English spelling thus provides morphological cues for the reader. Diachronically, we show that this system emerged without explicit regulation, but as a result of self-organization. We use the Helsinki corpus to show how variation was gradually reduced for each of the suffixes. The regular spellings of today emerged gradually, through a sorting-out process of competition between alternate spellings.* {$<$}/p{$>$}},

A further experiment revealed a radical-transposition effect, but only when a 4-radical character had 2 of its radicals transposed. In Exp 4 the transposition of characters within 2-character words revealed considerable interference, which confirmed the expectation that positional information is not so important in character-level representations. Results support a hierarchical framework for considering the recognition of Chinese words whereby there is both a radical and a character level of representation, with the former being directly activated by featural information.

Moreover, verbs tend to be more abstract than nouns, and this aspect might make verb processing more difficult. Finally, the developmental gap in the production of nouns and verbs suggests that age of acquisition might affect noun and verbs differently. Nouns and verbs were presented in a lexical decision and in a naming task. The morphological variable root frequency in addition to word frequency, length and word age of acquisition, and the semantic variables concreteness and context availability (P. J. Schwanenflugel, K. K. K. Harnishfeger, and R. W. Stowe, 1988) were used as predictors in multiple-regression analyses in which lexical decision and naming latencies were the dependent variables.

  abstract = {In this article we develop a fundamental rationale for teaching science to all children. We justify the teaching of science by linking scientific ways of thinking with the advancement of democratic society. Rather than simply treating science education as a civics course, we take the strong view that science education should produce a population with the skills to critically analyze and change society. Science students must learn science, but they must also learn about science, they must develop a scientific view of the world, and they must adopt some of the creative and critical attributes of scientists. To achieve these outcomes, science educators must be clear about what view of science they reflect and, in particular, they must reject both positivist and postmodernist elements. Science education must reflect the way in which the theories and practice of science are constrained by the real world. In setting out a robust answer to the question of why teach science we provide three aims for science education. These aims can assist science educators to decide what and how they teach, and help us all to defend science education from antiscientific criticisms. \textcopyright{} 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

Identification of partitive plurals with the homonymic suffix -jA was studied by presenting the target nouns in a sentence context and by recording durations of readers' eye fixations and self-paced reading times for these targets. A recent visual lexical decision study indicated that the same inflected words with -jA were sensitive to surface frequency manipulations, but not to base frequency manipulations. The authors interpreted these results to suggest that these inflectional forms are stored and processed by means of their whole-word representations. In contrast, the present context study shows both a surface frequency effect and a lagged base frequency effect. The authors argue that syntactic cues prior to the target word prime the inflectional reading of the -jA suffix, and as a consequence the base is reinstated as an effective unit in processing these nouns with a homonymic suffix.

However, Morris, Porter, Grainger, and Holcomb (Language \& Cognitive Processes, 26(4\textendash 6), 558\textendash 599, 2011)reported equivalent priming from suffixed and non-suffixed nonword primes, hence questioning the morphological nature of prior findings. Here we provide a further investigation of masked priming with morphologically complex nonword primes with an aim to isolate factors that modulate the size of these priming effects. We conducted a masked primed lexical decision experiment in French, in which the same target (TRISTE) was preceded by a suffixed word (tristesse), a suffixed nonword (tristerie), a non-suffixed nonword (tristald), or an unrelated prime word (direction). Participants were split into two groups, based on their language proficiency. The results show that in the high proficiency group, comparable magnitudes of priming were obtained in all three related prime conditions (including the non-suffixed condition) relative to unrelated primes, whereas in the low proficiency group, priming was significantly reduced in the non-suffixed condition compared to the two suffixed conditions. These findings provide further evidence that individual differences in language proficiency can modulate the impact of morphological factors during reading, and an explanation for the discrepant findings in prior research.},

Using a visual lexical decision task, we compared priming from truly suffixed primes (hunter-HUNT), completely opaque pseudo-suffixed primes (corner-CORN), and non-suffixed primes (cashew-CASH). The results show comparable magnitudes of priming for the truly suffixed and pseudo-suffixed primes, and no priming from non-suffixed primes, and therefore provide further important evidence in support of morpho-orthographic segmentation processes operating in the absence of any possible role for semantics.},

The ERP data revealed significant morphological but no semantic priming at 100\textendash 250 ms. Furthermore, a reduction of the N400 amplitude in the morphological condition compared to the semantic and orthographic condition demonstrates that the morphological priming effect was not entirely due to the semantic or orthographic overlap between the prime and the target. The present data reflect an early process of semantically blind morphological decomposition, and a later process of morpho-semantic decomposition, which we discuss in the context of recent morphological processing theories.},

Here we examine the specific nature of such priming effects by testing whether they are modulated by morphological family size. We reasoned that if the effects are driven by pre-lexical orthographic processing then they should not be influenced by the family size of the embedded target word. On the contrary, we found that embedded words having several morphologically related family members (e.g., serpentoche\textendash SERPENT [English: snakerel\textendash SNAKE]\textemdash serpents, serpentin, serpentine, serpenter, serpentant) generated greater priming than embedded words having only the plural form in the morphological family (e.g., dauphingri\textendash DAUPHIN [English: dolphinald\textendash DOLPHIN]). We therefore conclude that embedded stem priming is at least partly driven by processing at the level of lexical and morpho-semantic representations.

In this it can offer guiding flexible structure and in-road for teachers to design STEAM-based lessons, and to incorporate as an integrated aspect of students' STEAM learning. I discuss an example of an elementary Spanish teacher, who, as a student in a graduate-level design thinking and education course, used design thinking to design an interdisciplinary STEAM project for her students. This example illustrates how design thinking can guide teachers' STEAM curriculum design, and be interwoven into elements of STEAM curricula, to open up more interdisciplinary, creative and project-based opportunities.},

This possibility is examined in three studies. In Study 1, bilinguals outperformed monolinguals on versions of the problem containing moderate representational demands but not on a more demanding condition. Studies 2 and 3 demonstrated that bilingual children were more skilled than monolinguals when the target dimensions were perceptual features of the stimulus and that the two groups were equivalent when the target dimensions were semantic features. The conclusions are that bilinguals have better inhibitory control for ignoring perceptual information than monolinguals do but are not more skilled in representation, confirming the results of the original study. The results also identify the ability to ignore an obsolete display feature as the critical difficulty in solving this task.},

Perspective-taking has been assigned a major role in the elicitation and modulation of these vicarious responses.

We recorded facial electromyographic and electrocardiographic activity while participants watched videos of patients undergoing painful sonar treatment. These videos were watched using two distinct perspectives: a) imagining the patient's feelings (`imagine other'), or b) imagining to be in the patient's place (`imagine self'). The results revealed an unspecific frowning response as well as activity over the M. orbicularis oculi region which was specific to the `imagine self' perspective. This indicates that the pain-related tightening of the patients orbits was matched by participants when adopting this perspective. Our findings provide a physiological explanation for the more direct personal involvement and higher levels of personal distress associated with putting oneself explicitly into someone elses shoes. They provide further evidence that empathy does not only rely on automatic processes, but is also strongly influenced by top-down control and cognitive processes.},

Whereas in Hebrew, morphological processing is independent of semantics, in English, morphological activation is clearly modulated by semantic overlap.

  abstract = {Is morphology a discrete and independent element of lexical structure or does it simply reflect a fine-tuning of the system to the statistical correlation that exists among orthographic and semantic properties of words? Hebrew provides a unique opportunity to examine morphological processing in the brain because of its rich morphological system. In an fMRI masked priming experiment, we investigated the neural networks involved in implicit morphological processing in Hebrew. In the 1MFG and 1IFG, activation was found to be significantly reduced when the primes were morphologically related to the targets. This effect was not influenced by the semantic transparency of the morphological prime, and was not found in the semantic or orthographic condition. Additional morphologically related decrease in activation was found in the 1IPL, where activation was significantly modulated by semantic transparency. Our findings regarding implicit morphological processing suggest that morphology is an automatic and distinct aspect of visually processing words. These results also coincide with the behavioral data previously obtained demonstrating the central role of morphological processing in reading Hebrew.

In two studies, people predicted that losses in a gambling task would have greater hedonic impact than would gains of equal magnitude, but when people actually gambled, losses did not have as much of an emotional impact as they predicted. People overestimated the hedonic impact of losses because they underestimated their tendency to rationalize losses and overestimated their tendency to dwell on losses. The asymmetrical impact of losses and gains was thus more a property of affective forecasts than a property of affective experience.},

The prime stimuli were high-frequency words either from the same language as that of the target or from the other language known by the bilingual subjects. When the prime and target were from the same language, orthographically related primes systematically inhibited target word recognition, whereas orthographically dissimilar primes did not. When the prime and target were words from different languages, the amount of inhibition increased as a function of subjects' level of proficiency in the prime word's language, with highly proficient bilinguals showing practically equivalent amounts of within and across language inhibitory priming. These results strongly suggest that a printed string of letters can simultaneously activate lexical representations in both of the bilingual's languages (insofar as these share the same alphabet), even when subjects are performing a monolingual task.},

We recorded blood oxygenation signals from the temporal lobes of normal volunteers using functional magnetic resonance imaging during stimulation with unstructured noise, frequency-modulated (FM) tones, reversed speech, pseudowords and words. For all conditions, subjects performed a material- nonspecific detection response when a train of stimuli began or ceased. Dorsal areas surrounding Heschl's gyrus bilaterally, particularly the planum temporale and dorsolateral superior temporal gyrus, were more strongly activated by FM tones than by noise, suggesting a role in processing simple temporally encoded auditory information. Distinct from these dorsolateral areas, regions centered in the superior temporal sulcus bilaterally were more activated by speech stimuli than by FM tones. Identical results were obtained in this region using words, pseudowords and reversed speech, suggesting that the speech\textendash tones activation difference is due to acoustic rather than linguistic factors. In contrast, previous comparisons between word and nonword speech sounds showed left-lateralized activation differences in more ventral temporal and temporoparietal regions that are likely involved in processing lexical\textendash semantic or syntactic information associated with words. The results indicate functional subdivision of the human lateral temporal cortex and provide a preliminary framework for understanding the cortical processing of speech sounds.},

Recent neuroimaging studies demonstrate two striking results: the participation of modality-specific sensory, motor, and emotion systems in language comprehension, and the existence of large brain regions that participate in comprehension tasks but are not modality-specific. These latter regions, which include the inferior parietal lobe and much of the temporal lobe, lie at convergences of multiple perceptual processing streams. These convergences enable increasingly abstract, supramodal representations of perceptual experience that support a variety of conceptual functions including object recognition, social cognition, language, and the remarkable human capacity to remember the past and imagine the future.},

The participants were 87,798 men and 71,981 women who took part in a Web-based research project sponsored by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). The results yielded some evidence confirming prior findings that non-right-handedness is associated with homosexuality in men and women, that older brothers increase the odds of homosexuality in men, and that the effect of older brothers on sexual orientation is limited to right-handed men. The evidence was weaker than in previous studies, however, probably because the usual relations among the variables of interest were partially obscured by the effects of other factors. Thus, the homosexual men and women had higher rates of non-right-handedness than their heterosexual counterparts, but the strongest handedness finding for both sexes was a marked tendency for participants who described themselves as ambidextrous also to describe themselves as bisexual. The birth order data were strongly affected by a tendency for the male participants to report an excess of older sisters, and the female participants to report an excess of older brothers. Statistical analyses confirmed that this was an artifact of the parental stopping rule, ``Continue having children until you have offspring of both sexes.'' In subsequent analyses, participants were divided into those who did and did not have younger siblings, on the grounds that the data of the former would be less contaminated by the stopping rule. In the former subsample, the right-handed homo/bisexual males showed the typical high ratio of older brothers to older sisters, whereas the non-right-handed homo/bisexual males did not.},

Metaphorical senses could simply be added to the lexicon, as idioms, or combined with literal senses by abstraction. These approaches do not, as Lakoff and Johnson (1980) pointed out, account for systematicity. One can not only "grasp lectures," but "manipulate beliefs," "toss theories around," and "juggle formulas." A third possible strategy is sense extension, where rules derive a figurative sense by considering the violated literal constraints. The experiment reported here investigated such familiar and systematic metaphors, comparing the time to recognize words used in systematic metaphors as opposed to literal and anomalous control sentences. The results suggest a stage model of processing, in which the second, failure-driven stage is obligatory: If processing using literal senses (including any senses that have been lexicalized by idiom addition or abstraction) fails, then automatically check for any applicable sense extension rules. Finally, a computational model of the various strategies for lexicalization is briefly described.},

The relationship, in each case, persisted across a range of stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs: onset-to-onset) from 1000 down to 200 ms. Despite the apparent dissociation of P2 and N2, it could not be unequivocally established that they reflected successive discrete phases of processing. The balance of evidence indicated that the variation of both P2 and N2 across conditions could be attributed to a widely distributed, slow negative process, which began on the N1-P2 deflection, peaked at N2, and terminated beyond P3, and was enhanced when an automatically generated expectancy of a semantically associated word was violated. It is suggested that the negativity reflects an automatically generated enhancement of arousal that facilitates conscious processing of unexpected stimuli.},

For simplex, i.e., monomorphemic, nouns in Dutch, we studied the effect of the frequency of the monomorphemic noun itself as well as the effect of the frequencies of morphologically related forms on the processing of these monomorphemic nouns. The experiments show that the frequency of the (unseen) plural forms affects the experimental measures. Nouns with high-frequency plurals are responded to more quickly in visual lexical decision, and they receive higher subjective frequency ratings. However, the summed frequencies of the formations in the morphological family of a given noun (the compounds and derived words in which that noun appears as a constituent) did not affect the experimental measures. Surprisingly, the size of the morphological family, i.e., the number of different words in the family, emerged as a substantial factor. A monomorphemic noun with a large family size elicits higher subjective frequency ratings and shorter response latencies in visual lexical decision than a monomorphemic noun with a small family size. The effect of family size disappears in progressive demasking, a task which taps into the earlier stages of form identification. This suggests that the effect of family size arises at more central, post-identification stages of lexical processing.},

Here, we propose a theoretical framework based on a predictive coding architecture, within which negative language-related ERP components such as the N400 can be accounted for in a neurobiologically plausible manner. Specifically, we posit that the amplitude of negative language-related ERP components reflects precision-weighted prediction error signals, i.e., prediction errors weighted by the relevance of the information source leading to the error. From this perspective, precision has a direct link to cue validity in a particular language and, thereby, to relevance of individual linguistic features for internal model updating. We view components such as the N400 and LAN as members of a family with similar functional characteristics and suggest that latency and topography differences between these components reflect the locus of prediction errors and model updating within a hierarchically organized cortical predictive coding architecture. This account has the potential to unify findings from the full range of the N400 literature, including word-level, sentence-, and discourse-level results as well as cross-linguistic differences.},

One challenge to this type of research is the fact that languages vary in the most salient symptoms of SLI. This study focuses on Italian.Aims: To determine whether three measures \textemdash{} the use of third-person plural inflections, the use of direct-object clitics and non-word repetition \textemdash{} are successful in distinguishing Italian-speaking children with SLI from their typically developing peers.Methods \& Procedures: Eleven preschool-aged children with SLI, 11 same-age typically developing peers and 11 younger typically developing children participated in the study. The third-person plural inflection and direct-object clitic tasks required the children to describe drawings in response to prompts provided by the examiner. In the non-word repetition task, the children repeated non-words ranging from one to four syllables in length.Outcomes \& Results: All three measures proved successful either singly or in combination, with direct-object clitics and non-word repetition showing the highest sensitivity and specificity.Conclusions: Additional research should be pursued to replicate and extend these findings. Along with the potential clinical value of the findings, the results suggest that difficulties with non-final weak syllables \textemdash{} a problem that would adversely affect all three measures \textemdash{} may be an important part of the SLI profile in Italian.},

Experiment 1 used strong roots which undergo no allomorphy, and weak roots which undergo allomorphy and surface with only two of their three consonants in some derivations. Word pairs sharing a root morpheme prime each other reliably not only when the root was strong (e.g., [mu{$\Elzesh$}aarikun]/[{$\Elzesh$}aaraka] participant/participate), but also when it was weak (e.g., [ittifaaqun]/[waafaqa] agreement\textendash agree, where the weak root \{wfq\} surfaces fully in the target but not the prime). This facilitation occurred even when the weak root surfaced with different semantic meanings across prime and target (e.g., [itti{$\Elzyogh$}aahun]/[waa{$\Elzyogh$}aha] destination/confront). Experiment 2 assessed the effects of allomorphy on word pattern processing, comparing word pairs where the word pattern is transparently realised in both prime and target (e.g., [inta{$\Elzesh$}ara]/[i{$\Elzxh$}tamala] spread/bear], with pairs which share the same underlying word pattern but where a weak root triggers an assimilation process in the prime (e.g., [itta{$\Elzxh$}ada]/[ibtasama] unite/smile). This assimilation process does not disrupt the CV-structure of the word pattern, in contrast to a third condition where this is disrupted in both prime and target (e.g., [daara]/[qaala] turn around/say). Strong priming effects were observed in the first two conditions but not in the third. The bearing of these findings on models of lexical processing and representation is discussed.},

The stem will be activated in both cases after the suffix is removed prior to the lexical status of the letter-string being of relevance. Importantly, disruption to the stem and suffix through letter transposition should have the same impact on the nonwords and words, with teacehn and teacehr equally priming TEACH. However, an experiment by Diependaele, Morris, Serota, Bertrand, and Grainger () found that the equivalent priming for nonwords and words only occurred when they were intact. When letters were transposed, only the truly derived words showed priming. Since such a result cannot be handled by an obligatory decomposition account, it is important to replicate it. Therefore, the present study repeated the conditions of Diependaele et al. (), along with a nonword condition where the stem was followed by a non-suffix (e.g., teachin or teacihn). It was found that priming was maintained across all conditions regardless of letter transposition, hence maintaining obligatory decomposition as a viable account. However, the findings with the non-suffixed nonwords led to the conclusion that morphological structure does not control decomposition, but rather, has its impact after form-based components of the letter-string have been activated.},

  abstract = {Semitic morphology is based on the combination of two abstract discontinuous morphemes, the word pattern and the root. The word pattern specifies the phonological structure and morpho-syntactic properties of the surface form, while the consonantal root conveys core semantic information. Both units play a crucial role in processing Semitic languages such as Arabic and Hebrew. Here we use incremental masked priming to probe the time-course of word pattern and root activation in reading Arabic deverbal nouns and verbs. The morphological (word pattern and root), orthographic, and semantic relationship between prime and targets is varied over four stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) (32, 48, 64, and 80 ms). Results show distinctive patterns of activation for the two morphemic entities. Word pattern effects are transient, and detectable only at SOAs 48 and 64 in deverbal nouns and SOA 48 in verbs. Root effects are strong at all SOAs. This may reflect differences in the timing with which word pattern and root information can be extracted from the orthographic input, as well as differences in the roles of these morphemes in building internal lexical representations. Both types of morphemic effect contrast strongly with the effects of orthographic and semantic primes, where reliable facilitation is only obtained at the longest SOA (80 ms). The general pattern of results is consistent with the view that morphological effects in Semitic languages represent distinct structural characteristics of the language.},

More specifically, its aim is to clarify the relations between science as the investigation of 'truths' that people hold at a particular time, on the one hand, and art as carrier of these truths into the 'emotional' realm of the people, on the other. The goal is simple; as is the method. The goal is to provide a way of teaching the humanities based on the aesthetic.[1] The method uses the figures chosen to act as a foil to each other, so that what seems to be a parallel of contrasts between Darwin and Gauguin, is, in fact, an equilibrium of the sensual and the rational. [2] The specific point that the paper argues is this: if teaching the humanities is tied pedagogically to art, then science, as well as the other disciplines, will join the curriculum in an integral way so as to contribute to the complete education of the student: physical, intellectual, moral, and spiritual. The first section of the paper develops the education of reason or mind in the life and thoughts of Charles Darwin. My remarks here will be limited primarily, but not exclusively, to his autobiography. The second part clarifies the education of the senses in the thoughts of Paul Gauguin.},

  abstract = {Standard views of morphology in Modern Standard Arabic hold that surface word forms comprise at least 2 morphemes: a 3-consonantal root conveying semantic meaning and a word pattern carrying syntactic information. An alternative account claims that semantic information is carried by a bi-consonantal morphological unit called the etymon. Accordingly, in the form [batara] the core meaning is carried not by the tri-consonantal root morpheme btr but by the etymon morpheme b,t which surfaces in other forms like [batta] "sever," [batala] "cut off" with the same meaning "cutting." Previous experimental research in Semitic languages has assumed the tri-consonantal root/word pattern approach. In cross-modal and masked priming experiments we ask whether the etymon, as a more fine-grained 2-consonantal morphological unit, can yield the morphological priming effects typically obtained with tri-consonantal root morphemes. The results clearly show that 2 words sharing an etymon do facilitate each other both in cross-modal and masked priming even though they do not share a root, controlling for semantic and for form overlap effects. The bearing of these results on theories of morphological processing and representation is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2002 APA, all rights reserved).},

When compared with normally achieving children who read nonwords and exception words equally well, Chinese readers scored as well as these children on word identification, regular word reading, orthographic choice, spelling, reading comprehension, phonological sensitivity, and verbal ability and scored better on exception word reading. Chinese readers also used rhyme-based analogies to read nonwords derived from high-frequency exception words just as often as did these children. As predicted, Phoenician and Chinese readers adopted somewhat different strategies in reading ambiguous nonwords constructed by analogy to high-frequency exception words. Phoenician readers were more likely than Chinese readers to read ambiguous monosyllabic nonwords via context-free grapheme\textendash phoneme correspondences and were less likely to read disyllabic nonwords by analogy to high-frequency analogues. Although the Chinese reading style was more common than the Phoenician style in normally achieving fourth graders, there were similar numbers of poor readers with phonological dyslexia (identifying nonwords significantly more accurately than exception words) and surface dyslexia (showing the reverse pattern), although surface dyslexia was more common in the severely disabled readers.

It is shown how the development of a vernacular, popularly called a dialect, into a language is intimately related to the development of writing and the growth of nationalism. This process is shown to involve the selection, codification, acceptance, and elaboration of a linguistic norm.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present a critique of pure insertion. Pure insertion represents an implicit assumption behind many (but not all) studies that employ cognitive subtraction. The main contention is that pure insertion is not valid in relation to the neuronal instantiation of cognitive processes. Pure insertion asserts that there are no interactions among the cognitive components of a task. It is possible to evaluate and refute this assumption by testing explicitly for interactions using factorial experimental designs. It is proposed that factorial designs are more powerful than subtraction designs in characterizing cognitive neuroanatomy, precisely because they allow for interactions and eschew notions like pure insertion. In particular we suggest that the effect of a cognitive component (i.e., an effect that is independent of other components) is best captured by the main (activation) effect of that component and that the integration among components (i.e., the expression of one cognitive process in the context of another) can be assessed with the interaction terms. In this framework a complete characterization of cognitive neuroanatomy includes both regionally specific activations and regionally specific interactions. To illustrate our point we have used a factorial experimental design to show that inferotemporal activations, due to object recognition, are profoundly modulated by phonological retrieval of the object's name. This interaction implicates the inferotemporal regions in phonological retrieval, during object naming, despite the fact that phonological retrieval does not, by itself, activate this region.},

  abstract = {e 19941SAST INTRODUCTION ART AND SCIENCE: SIMILARITIES, DIFFERENCES AND INTERACTIONS Wile many past articles (and several special issues) of Leonardodescribe applications of new technologies to the visual arts, a far smaller number have dealt with the interaction of art and science, as this special issue does. This is not surprising, since the links between art and science are less apparent than those between art and technology; however, they are no less important, since science provides us with insight about our world and how we relate to it. This insight is based not only on scientific results or concepts but also on the way science is made. Both art and science allow us to confront or grasp reality, and it is enlightening to compare the ways in which they make it possible (see, for example, the articles in the first section of this issue). Whether the end result is a work of art or science, the act of creating has many similarities. At the same time, the differences between the two disciplines can reveal much about the nature of both. It is obviously as difficult for an artist to "step inside" the mind of a scientist as it is for a scientist to fully understand the artist. However, descriptions of the creative work of artists and scientists themselves-first-hand accounts of the thoughts and feelings that guide or accompany the work-can be illuminating to practitioners of both disciplines . Creative work can also be analyzed from a philosophical point of view or from that of neuroscience. Scientific concepts themselves can also be used to describe and aid the understanding of some aspects of art (see, for example, the articles in the second section of this issue). These concepts can also influence or inspire artists who use science as the subject matter or basis of their work (see the articles in the third section of this issue). When scientists want to describe or understand a reality that is beyond what we can see with our eyes-for example, the infinitely small, the cosmos or extremely high speeds-they cannot refer to our usual intuition, which is formed during our experience with objects on our own scale. Scientists have to acquire a new intuition, to discover or invent new concepts (which often can only be correctly expressed mathematically) or find new ways of thinking that perhaps are not specific to science but that science has brought to light [1]. New scientific concepts, in addition to their poetic appeal, have the capacity to enlarge the imagination and the artistic vocabulary of an artist. An example of such a "new" concept is that of the "wave-particle," which sometimes behaves like a traditional wave and sometimes like a traditional particle but is different from both. The subtle image this concept conveys is used to describe matter on the atomic scale. Although scientific concepts are valid subjects, it would be naive to think that their mere use as a theme or even a structure on which to base a work of art automatically insures the artistic interest of this work (in the same manner that the use of new technology does not insure that an artist will create a contemporary work of art). The aim of art is not to illustrate science any more than Cezanne's apple was intended to illustrate horticultural catalogues. An artist can also "include his experience (of science) as part of his total human experience," according to L. Alcopley [2], thereby expressing scientific culture instead of using isolated scientific concepts [3]. Alcopley does just this with the two wide brush strokes shown on the front cover of this special issue, creating a painting as clear as scientific reasoning by retaining only relevant elements. In the scientific and technological world in which we live today, it is as important to situate art with respect to science as it was to situate art with respect to religion in the Middle Ages. Indeed, the comparison of art and science can lead to a better understanding of both.

  year = {1998},
  abstract = {Low frequency words in English show a regularity effect; words whose spellings represent regular phonemic patterns like "mint" show advantages in naming and lexical decision tasks over words like "pint" that have exceptional relations between orthographic and phonemic patterns. Recently studies have shown that English marks a word's lexical stress in addition to its segmental phonology. Here, it is shown that the regularity effects found in the domain of segmental phonology can be extended to the domain of lexical stress. Disyllabic words whose spellings are consistent with their stress (regular words) are easier to process than words whose spellings are misleading about stress (exception words). Experiment 1 demonstrates that in a word naming task, regular words are named faster and are pronounced with incorrect stress less often than exception words. Experiments 2 and 3 show that regular words are also classified more quickly and accurately in lexical decision tasks than are exception words. Similar results were found in the domain of word production using a newly developed typing task designed to measure spelling response times. Subjects were faster to initiate typing, and made fewer errors on regular than on exception words. These results indicate that literate speakers have learned orthographic correlates to lexical stress in English and use these correlates in online lexical processing. The similarity between the regularity effects found in the phonemic and prosodic domains, indicate that models of reading developed for the former, could be extended to the latter area.

D., \& Tyler, L. K. Morphology, language and the brain: The decompositional substrate for language comprehension. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society: Biological Sciences, 362, 823\textendash 836, 2007]. Here we investigated how English derivationally complex words engage these systems, asking whether they selectively activate the LH system in the same way as inflections or whether they primarily engage the bilateral system that support nondecompositional access. In an fMRI study, we saw no evidence for selective activation of the LH frontotemporal system, even for highly transparent forms like bravely. Instead, a combination of univariate and multivariate analyses revealed the engagement of a distributed bilateral system, modulated by factors of perceptual complexity and semantic transparency. We discuss the implications for theories of the processing and representation of English derivational morphology and highlight the importance of neurobiological constraints in understanding these processes.},

In contrast, processing of lexicalized and unpredictable complexity, present in derived words (e.g. bravely, warmth), engages a bilateral subsystem, which underpins whole-word, stem-based lexical access. We suggest a potential neurobiological framework for this proposed organization. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

As a result, children must segment the utterances they hear in order to discover the sound patterns of individual words in their language. A number of computational models have been proposed to explain how children segment speech and discover words, including ten new models in the last five years. This paper reviews all proposed models and organizes them according to their fundamental segmentation strategies, their processing characteristics, and the ways in which they use memory. All proposed models are found to use one of three fundamental strategies: the utterance-boundary strategy, the predictability strategy, or the word-recognition strategy. Selected predictions of the models are explained, their performance in computer simulations is summarized, and behavioral evidence bearing on them is discussed. Finally, ideas about how these diverse models might be synthesized into one comprehensive model are offered.},

  abstract = {Many researchers in the behavioral sciences depend on research software that presents stimuli, and records response times, with sub-millisecond precision. There are a large number of software packages with which to conduct these behavioral experiments and measure response times and performance of participants. Very little information is available, however, on what timing performance they achieve in practice. Here we report a wide-ranging study looking at the precision and accuracy of visual and auditory stimulus timing and response times, measured with a Black Box Toolkit. We compared a range of popular packages: PsychoPy, E-Prime\textregistered, NBS Presentation\textregistered, Psychophysics Toolbox, OpenSesame, Expyriment, Gorilla, jsPsych, Lab.js and Testable. Where possible, the packages were tested on Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu, and in a range of browsers for the online studies, to try to identify common patterns in performance. Among the lab-based experiments, Psychtoolbox, PsychoPy, Presentation and E-Prime provided the best timing, all with mean precision under 1 millisecond across the visual, audio and response measures. OpenSesame had slightly less precision across the board, but most notably in audio stimuli and Expyriment had rather poor precision. Across operating systems, the pattern was that precision was generally very slightly better under Ubuntu than Windows, and that macOS was the worst, at least for visual stimuli, for all packages. Online studies did not deliver the same level of precision as lab-based systems, with slightly more variability in all measurements. That said, PsychoPy and Gorilla, broadly the best performers, were achieving very close to millisecond precision on several browser/operating system combinations. For response times (measured using a high-performance button box), most of the packages achieved precision at least under 10 ms in all browsers, with PsychoPy achieving a precision under 3.5 ms in all. There was considerable variability between OS/browser combinations, especially in audio-visual synchrony which is the least precise aspect of the browser-based experiments. Nonetheless, the data indicate that online methods can be suitable for a wide range of studies, with due thought about the sources of variability that result. The results, from over 110,000 trials, highlight the wide range of timing qualities that can occur even in these dedicated software packages for the task. We stress the importance of scientists making their own timing validation measurements for their own stimuli and computer configuration.},

METHODS: Pointers to individual research efforts were obtained through the HBP home page as well as personal contracts from HBP annual meetings. References from these sources were followed to find closely related work. The individual research efforts were then studied and characterized. RESULTS: The subject of the review is the intersection of neuroinformatics (information about the brain), imaging informatics (information about images), and structural informatics (information about the physical structure of the body). Of the 30 funded projects currently listed on the HBP web site, at least 22 make heavy use of images. These projects are described in terms of broad categories of structural imaging, functional imaging, and image-based brain information systems. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the most complex entity known (the brain) gives rise to many interesting and difficult problems in informatics and computer science. Although much progress has been made by HBP and other neuroinformatics researchers, a great many problems remain that will require substantial informatics research efforts. Thus, the HPB can and should be seen as an excellent driving application area for biomedical informatics research.},

  abstract = {For more than two decades now, cognitive science has been making overtures to literature and literary studies. Only recently, however, cognitive linguistics and poetics seem to be moving towards a more serious and reciprocal type of interdisciplinarity. In coupling cognitive linguistics and poetics, cognitive poeticians aim to offer cognitive readings of literary texts and formulate specific hypotheses concerning the relationship between aesthetic meaning effects and patterns in the cognitive construal and processing of literary texts. One of the basic assumptions of the endeavour is that some of the key topics in poetics (such as the construction of text worlds, characterization, narrative perspective, distancing discourse, etc.) may be fruitfully approached by applying cognitive linguistic concepts and insights (such as embodied cognition, metaphor, mental spaces, iconicity, construction grammar, figure/ground alignment, etc.), in an attempt to support, enrich or adjust `traditional' poetic analysis. Conversely, the tradition of poetics may support, frame or call into question insights form cognitive linguistics. In order to capture the goals, gains and gaps of this rapidly growing interdisciplinary field of research, this volume brings together some of the key players and critics of cognitive poetics. The eleven chapters are grouped into four major sections, each dealing with central concerns of the field: (i) the cognitive mechanisms, discursive means and mental products related to narrativity (Semino, Herman, Culpeper); (ii) the different incarnations of the concept of figure in cognitive poetics (Freeman, Steen, Tsur); (iii) the procedures that are meant to express or create discursive attitudes, like humour, irony or distance in general (Antonopoulou and Nikiforidou, Dancygier and Vandelanotte, Giora et al.); and (iv) a critical assessment of the current state of affairs in cognitive poetics, and more specifically the incorporation of insights from cognitive linguistics as only one of the contributing fields in the interdisciplinary conglomerate of cognitive science (Louwerse and Van Peer, Sternberg).The ensuing dialogue between cognitive and literary partners, as well as between advocates and opponents, is promoted through the use of short response articles included after ten chapters of the volume.

This aspect of representation of mind is viewed from cognitive, evolutionary, and neural perspectives. It is proposed to be modular and normally operates in association with a valence-free cognition able to represent mental states such as belief. Examples of neural activity capable of supporting the social representations that macaque monkeys are believed to possess are presented. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {In traditional theories of language comprehension, syntactic and semantic processing are inextricably linked. This assumption has been challenged by the `Semantic Illusion Effect' found in studies using Event Related brain Potentials. Semantically anomalous sentences did not produce the expected increase in N400 amplitude but rather one in P600 amplitude. To explain these findings, complex models have been devised in which an independent semantic processing stream can arrive at a sentence interpretation that may differ from the interpretation prescribed by the syntactic structure of the sentence. We review five such multi-stream models and argue that they do not account for the full range of relevant results because they assume that the amplitude of the N400 indexes some form of semantic integration. Based on recent evidence we argue that N400 amplitude might reflect the retrieval of lexical information from memory. On this view, the absence of an N400-effect in Semantic Illusion sentences can be explained in terms of priming. Furthermore, we suggest that semantic integration, which has previously been linked to the N400 component, might be reflected in the P600 instead. When combined, these functional interpretations result in a single-stream account of language processing that can explain all of the Semantic Illusion data.},

This finding led to a considerable amount of debate, and a number of complex processing models have been proposed as an explanation. What these models have in common is that they postulate two or more separate processing streams, in order to reconcile the Semantic Illusion and other semantically induced P600 effects with the traditional interpretations of the N400 and the P600. Recently, however, these multi-stream models have been called into question, and a simpler single-stream model has been proposed. According to this alternative model, the N400 component reflects the retrieval of word meaning from semantic memory, and the P600 component indexes the integration of this meaning into the unfolding utterance interpretation. In the present paper, we provide support for this ``Retrieval\textendash Integration (RI)'' account by instantiating it as a neurocomputational model. This neurocomputational model is the first to successfully simulate the N400 and P600 amplitude in language comprehension, and simulations with this model provide a proof of concept of the single-stream RI account of semantically induced patterns of N400 and P600 modulations.},

To assess the impact of automatic LA processes on the N400, the effect of masked presentations (MPs) and unmasked presentations (UMPs) of a prime on the N400 to a following target was compared. The RT study showed a significant semantic priming effect under both UMPs and MPs of the prime. The result for masked priming reflects the effect of automatic spreading of activation during the LA process. The ERP study showed a significant N400 effect for the UMP condition, but no such effect for the MP condition. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2006 APA, all rights reserved).},

We specifically examined the ERP correlates of producing morphologically complex words in 8-year-olds, 12-year-olds and adults, by recording ERPs during the silent production of compounds with plural or singular modifiers. Results for both children and adults revealed a negativity in response to compounds produced from regular plural forms when compared to compounds formed from irregular plurals, indicating a highly specific brain response to a subtle linguistic contrast. Although children performed behaviourally with an adult-like pattern in the task, we found a broader distribution and a considerably later latency in children's brain potentials than in adults', indicating that even in late childhood the brain networks involved in language processing are subject to subtle developmental changes.},

Exp 2 shifts attention from monomorphemic words to complex words. Exp 3 addresses the question to what extent the presence or absence of an inflectional suffix affects the activation of the family members. Exp 4 explored the Family size effect for perfect participles. Ss were 198 native Dutch speakers. Results from Exp 1 found a similar effect of Family size for verbs without a nominal conversion alternant as for nouns without a verbal conversion alternant.

Exp 3 showed that the Family size effect for complex words has a genuine morphological component independent of a semantic component. Exp 4 revealed an effect of Family size on both kinds of participles.

Before being allowed to see a face, the monkeys showed a preference for human and monkey faces in photographs, and they discriminated human faces as well as monkey faces.

Soon after, the monkeys selectively discriminated the exposed species of face and showed a marked difficulty in regaining the ability to discriminate the other nonexposed species of face. These results indicate the existence of an experience-independent ability for face processing as well as an apparent sensitive period during which a broad but flexible face prototype develops into a concrete one for efficient processing of familiar faces.},

Three different tasks were administered under four conditions: baseline simple RT; attention-demanding ongoing task only; ongoing task plus a delayed intention (unpracticed); ongoing task plus delayed intention (practiced). Under prospective memory conditions, we found significant rCBF decreases in the superior medial aspects of the rostral prefrontal cortex (BA 10) relative to the baseline or ongoing task only conditions. However more lateral aspects of area 10 (plus the medio-dorsal thalamus) showed the opposite pattern, with rCBF increases in the prospective memory conditions relative to the other conditions. These patterns were broadly replicated over all three tasks. Since both the medial and lateral rostral regions showed: (a) instances where rCBF was lower during a more effortful condition (as estimated by increased RTs and error rates) than in a less effortful one; and (b) there was no correlation between rCBF and RT durations or number of errors in these regions, a simple task difficulty explanation of the rCBF changes in the rostral aspects of the frontal lobes during prospective memory tasks is rejected. Instead, the favoured explanation concentrates upon the particular processing demands made by these situations irrespective of the precise stimuli used or the exact nature of the intention. Moreover, the results suggest different roles for medial and lateral rostral prefrontal cortex, with the former involved in suppressing internally-generated thought, and the latter in maintaining it.},

These results challenge claims that form-based, semantically blind activation underlies early morphological facilitation. Some have argued that the English materials in previous studies were not ideally constructed, insofar as the types of spelling changes to affixed stems differed in the semantically similar and dissimilar pairs. The present study exploited Serbian,\"A\^os bialphabetism, rich morphology, and homographic (form-identical) stems to replicate early effects of semantic similarity. Furthermore, it incorporated within-target manipulations of prime type and of alphabet, such that the alphabets of the prime,\"A\`itarget pairs matched in Experiment 1a and alternated in Experiment 1b. Importantly, no letter or phoneme changes occurred between the stems of the primes and targets. These results revealed significant effects of semantic similarity that are comparable with and without alphabet alternation. The semantic effects in Serbian replicated almost exactly those in English (Feldman et al., Psychonomic Bulletin \& Review 16: 684,\"A\`i691, 2009), which suggests that even early in the course of processing, morphemes are units of meaning as well as of form. The results failed to support models of lexical processing that postulate sequential access, first to the morphological form, and then to the semantic aspects of words.

The current sources and sinks form dipoles or higher-order n-poles.Extracellular currents arise from many sources, including synaptic currents, fast action potentials and their afterpotentials, calcium spikes and voltage-dependent intrinsic currents.The magnitude of extracellular currents depends critically on two factors: the cytoarchitectural organization of a network and the temporal synchrony of the various current sinks and sources.Depending on the recording method, neuroscientists distinguish between electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocorticogram (ECoG) and local field potential (LFP; also known as micro-, depth or intracranial EEG), although all of these measures refer to the same biophysical process.The electric field is the force 'felt' by an electric charge, and can be transmitted through brain volume. The extent of volume conduction depends on the relationships between the current dipole and the features of the conductive medium.High-density sampling of the extracellular field with contemporary methods enables the calculation of current source density, and therefore the localization of current sinks and sources.The voltage gradients generated by highly synchronous activity of neuronal groups can affect the transmembrane potential of the member neurons and alter their excitability through ephaptic coupling.Synchronous spiking of nearby neurons is the main source of the high-frequency components of the local field.There is a discernable relationship between the temporal evolution of cell assemblies and the time-dependent changes of the spatially distributed currents. High-density, wide-band recordings of the local field can therefore provide access to both afferent inputs and the spiking output of neurons.},

The research reported here investigated the influence of semantic transparency on long-term morphological priming. Two experiments demonstrated that while lexical decisions were facilitated by semantically transparent primes like TEACHER, semantically opaque words like CORNER had no effect. Although differences in the nonword foils used in each experiment gave rise to somewhat different patterns of results, this difference in the effects of transparent and opaque primes was found in both experiments.

Whereas the basic tenet of MMN is appealing, several issues-of-contention remain to be solved before this event related potential (ERP) can be applicable for routine clinical use. These issues include the consistent identification of MMN within individuals (vs. groups), its stability over time, and its reportedly poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

Since Italian is a PRO-DROP language, the authors expect that adult-to-child speech will show a bias towards a more salient semantic and morphological significance of verbs relative to nouns. The authors expect that verbs will more likely occupy the sentence-initial position, and have more morphological inflections relative to nouns. Mother-to-child speech was coded for type and token frequency, utterance position, and morphological variation of nouns and verbs. The results confirm our predictions. Namely, Italian-speaking mothers produced verb types and tokens more frequently than noun types and tokens, they placed verbs more frequently than nouns in salient utterance position, and they morphologically marked verb stems.

In what is likely to become the standard for future studies in this area, Lynne Cameron meticulously demonstrates the central role of linguistic metaphors in classroom learning - designed to lead learners to a deeper understanding of complex mathematical and scientific concepts.'James P. Lantolf, Professor of Applied Linguistics, The Pennsylvania State University.This book reports research into metaphor in use with school students. The setting for the research is a UK school and the participants are around ten years old, with their first language well established but still developing concepts and understandings. Close examination of a corpus of classroom spoken discourse reveals how metaphor is employed by their teachers, not just in explaining ideas, but, in managing and mediating the activity of the classroom and the learning of the students. Particular issues discussed include: the problems of identifying metaphors in spoken discourse, the conventionalism of metaphors in the discourse of socio-cultural groups, and how a socio-cultural approach can account for systematicity in metaphor use.},

We compared two types of gender information, definitional information, which is semantic in nature (a mother is female), or stereotypical (a nurse is likely to be female). When they followed definitional role-nouns, gender-mismatching pronouns elicited a P600 effect reflecting a failure in the agreement process. When instead the gender violation occurred after stereotypical role-nouns the Event Related Potential response was biphasic, being positive in parietal electrodes and negative in anterior left electrodes. The use of a correlational approach showed that those participants with more ``feminine'' or ``expressive'' self sex-role descriptions showed a P600 response for stereotype violations, suggesting that they experienced the mismatch as an agreement violation; whereas less ``expressive'' participants showed an Nref effect, indicating more effort spent in linking the pronouns with the possible, although less likely, counter-stereotypical referent.},

We review the concept of working memory as a short-duration system in which small amounts of information are simultaneously stored and manipulated in the service of accomplishing a task. We summarize the argument that syntactic processing in sentence comprehension requires such a storage and computational system. We then ask whether the working memory system used in syntactic processing is the same as that used in verbally mediated tasks that involve conscious controlled processing. Evidence is brought to bear from various sources: the relationship between individual differences in working memory and individual differences in the efficiency of syntactic processing; the effect of concurrent verbal memory load on syntactic processing; and syntactic processing in patients with poor short-term memory, patients with poor working memory, and patients with aphasia. Experimental results from these normal subjects and patients with various brain lesions converge on the conclusion that there is a specialization in the verbal working memory system for assigning the syntactic structure of a sentence and using that structure in determining sentence meaning that is separate from the working memory system underlying the use of sentence meaning to accomplish other functions. We present a theory of the divisions of the verbal working memory system and suggestions regarding its neural basis.},

Here, we examined changes in masked morphological priming across grade within a large sample of French primary school children (n=191, Grades 2\textendash 5) and how these effects are modulated by individual differences in reading proficiency, spelling proficiency, and morphological awareness. Target words were preceded by either (a) a suffixed word prime (e.g., tristesse\textendash TRISTE), (b) a suffixed nonword prime (e.g., tristerie\textendash TRISTE), (c) a non-suffixed nonword prime (e.g., tristald\textendash TRISTE), or (d) an unrelated prime (e.g., direction\textendash TRISTE) using very short prime durations (50ms). Moreover, a frequency manipulation was included for suffixes and non-suffixes. The results revealed robust suffixed word priming across all children independent of grade and proficiency. On the other hand, priming in the suffixed and non-suffixed nonword conditions was modulated by reading proficiency, with high-proficiency children showing facilitation and low-proficiency children showing inhibition. The effects of suffix and non-suffix frequency were modulated by grade, with decreasing effects as grade increased. None of the observed priming effects were modulated by grade, spelling proficiency, or morphological awareness. The results suggest that reading proficiency is an important predictor for embedded stem activation mechanisms in primary school children, which we discuss in the context of recent theories of morphological processing.},

We have investigated four cases of English-speaking subjects with WS, and we show that despite their low IQs the WS children's performance on syntactic tasks and on regular inflection is not impaired. Irregular inflection, however, is affected causing many errors. We also report results from studies investigating the same linguistic phenomena in children with specific language impairment. These children exhibit a different pattern of impairment, with relatively poor performance on syntactic tasks and regular inflection. We suggest a linguistic characterization of the morphosyntax in WS according to which WS subjects are impaired in accessing (particular kinds of) information from lexical entries, with their computational system for language appearing to be intact. We interpret the selective impairments found in WS and SLI as supporting the theoretical distinction between a computational system and an associative memory system for language.},

We have adapted one such rating scale, the Abbreviated Math Anxiety Scale (AMAS), to be used with British children aged 8\textendash 13. In this study, we assess the scale's reliability, factor structure, and divergent validity. The modified AMAS (mAMAS) was administered to a very large (n = 1746) cohort of British children and adolescents. This large sample size meant that as well as conducting confirmatory factor analysis on the scale itself, we were also able to split the sample to conduct exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis of items from the mAMAS alongside items from child test anxiety and general anxiety rating scales. Factor analysis of the mAMAS confirmed that it has the same underlying factor structure as the original AMAS, with subscales measuring anxiety about Learning and Evaluation in math. Furthermore, both exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis of the mAMAS alongside scales measuring test anxiety and general anxiety showed that mAMAS items cluster onto one factor (perceived to represent MA). The mAMAS provides a valid and reliable scale for measuring MA in children and adolescents, from a younger age than is possible with the original AMAS. Results from this study also suggest that MA is truly a unique construct, separate from both test anxiety and general anxiety, even in childhood.},

Methods: EEG was recorded from 23 subjects while they performed a simple choice reaction time task requiring discrimination of squares and circles. In separate blocks stimulus size, duration, and eccentricity were manipulated. EEG was recorded from 64 electrodes. A wavelet transform based on Morlet wavelets was employed for the analysis of gamma-band activity. Results: Amplitude of the GBR was diminished for small and peripheral stimuli. With short stimulus durations ON and OFF responses of the GBR merged into one peak. In comparison, VEP amplitudes were less susceptible to stimulus features. In contrast to VEP latencies, however, GBR latency did not show a lateralization for eccentric stimuli. Conclusions: In addition to previous experiments which have shown a modulation of the GBR by various cognitive processes, the present results demonstrate the susceptibility of the GBR in human EEG to exogenous factors, as numerous intracortical recordings in non-human primates have shown before. The results suggest that the human GBR resides in early visual areas. Significance: The demonstration of the susceptibility of the GBR to stimulus properties implies that studies aimed at exploring the involvement of the GBR in information processing have to be designed carefully. It also constrains the localization of the human GBR.},

In Experiment 2, high- and low-frequency words and pseudowords were presented in the congruent and incongruent conditions. The results again showed congruency effects at the P200 for low-frequency words and pseudowords, but not for high-frequency words.

  abstract = {2.1 Abstract Users of software systems acquire knowledge about the system and how to use it through experience, training, and imitation. Currently, there is a great deal of debate about exactly what users know about software. This knowledge may include one or more of the following:\textbullet simple rules that prescribe a sequence of actions that apply in certain conditions,\textbullet general methods that fit certain general situations and goals,\textbullet ``mental models,'' knowledge of the components of a system, their interconnection, and the processes that change the components; knowledge that forms the basis for users being able to construct reasonable actions; and explanations about why a set of actions is appropriate. Discovering what users know and how these different forms of knowledge fit together in learning and performance is important. It applies to the problem of designing systems and training programs so that the systems are easy to use and the learning is efficient. Research on the effects of different representations on ultimate performance is mixed. Research on exactly what users know is scattered. Analytical methods and techniques for representing what the user knows are sparse but growing. This paper reviews current work and through the review, identifies several important research needs:\textbullet Detail what kinds of mental representations people have of systems that allow them to behave appropriately in using the software.\textbullet Detail what a mental model would consist of and how a person would use it to decide what action to take next.\textbullet Produce evidence that people have and use mental models.\textbullet Determine the behaviors that would demonstrate a mental model's form and the operations used on the model.\textbullet Explore alternative views of goal-directed representations (e.g., so-called ``sequence/method representations'') and detail the behavior predicted from them.\textbullet Expand the types of mental representations that may exist to include those that may not be mechanistic, such as algebraic systems and visual systems.\textbullet Determine how people intermix different representations in producing behavior.\textbullet Explore how knowledge about systems is acquired.\textbullet Determine how individual differences have an impact on learning of and performance on systems.\textbullet Explore the design of training sequences for systems.\textbullet Provide systems designers with tools to help them develop systems that evoke ``good'' representations in users.\textbullet Expand the task domain of this research to include more complex software.},

Discusses the progression of human\textendash computer interaction (HCI) toward a science of design. HCI study is the region of intersection between psychology, the social sciences, computer science, and technology. HCI researchers analyze and design specific user interface technologies (e.g., pointing devices), study and improve the processes of technology development (e.g., task analysis, design rationale), and develop and evaluate new applications of technology (e.g., word processors, digital libraries). The author reviews how, throughout the past 2 decades, HCI has progressively integrated its scientific concerns with the engineering goal of improving the usability of computer systems and applications, which has resulted in a body of technical knowledge and methodology.

  abstract = {Linguistic predictions may be generated from and evaluated against a representation of events and referents described in the discourse. Compatible with this idea, recent work shows that predictions about novel noun phrases include their definiteness. In the current follow-up study, we ask whether people engage similar prediction-related processes for definite and indefinite referents. This question is relevant for linguistic theories that imply a processing difference between definite and indefinite noun phrases, typically because definiteness is thought to require a uniquely identifiable referent in the discourse. We addressed this question in an event-related potential (ERP) study (N = 48) with preregistration of data acquisition, preprocessing, and Bayesian analysis. Participants read Dutch mini-stories with a definite or indefinite novel noun phrase (e.g., ``het/een huis,'' the/a house), wherein (in)definiteness of the article was either expected or unexpected and the noun was always strongly expected. Unexpected articles elicited enhanced N400s, but unexpectedly indefinite articles also elicited a positive ERP effect at frontal channels compared to expectedly indefinite articles. We tentatively link this effect to an antiuniqueness violation, which may force people to introduce a new referent over and above the already anticipated one. Interestingly, expectedly definite nouns elicited larger N400s than unexpectedly definite nouns (replicating a previous surprising finding) and indefinite nouns. Although the exact nature of these noun effects remains unknown, expectedly definite nouns may have triggered the strongest semantic activation because they alone refer to specific and concrete referents. In sum, results from both the articles and nouns clearly demonstrate that definiteness marking has a rapid effect on processing, counter to recent claims regarding definiteness processing.},

While the poor phonological awareness of dyslexic children has been related to their difficulty in handling the alphabetical principle, less is known about their morphological awareness, which also plays an important part in reading development. The aim of this study was to analyze in more detail the implications of the phonological impairments of dyslexics in dealing with larger units of language such as morphemes. First, the performance of dyslexic children in a series of morphological tasks was compared with the performance of children matched on reading-level and chronological age. In all the tasks, the dyslexic group performed below the chronological age control group, suggesting that morphological awareness cannot be developed entirely independently of reading experience and/or phonological skills. Comparisons with the reading-age control group indicated that, while the dyslexic children were poorer in the morphemic segmentation tasks, they performed normally for their reading level in the sentence completion tasks. Furthermore, they produced more derived words in the production task. This suggests that phonological impairments prevent the explicit segmentation of affixes while allowing the development of productive morphological knowledge. A second study compared dyslexic subgroups defined by their degree of phonological impairment. Our results suggest that dyslexics develop a certain type of morphological knowledge, which they use as a compensatory reading strategy.},

Research in psychological science has provided answers to many of these questions but, somewhat surprisingly, this research has been slow to make inroads into educational policy and practice. Instead, the field has been plagued by decades of ``reading wars.'' Even now, there remains a wide gap between the state of research knowledge about learning to read and the state of public understanding. The aim of this article is to fill this gap. We present a comprehensive tutorial review of the science of learning to read, spanning from children's earliest alphabetic skills through to the fluent word recognition and skilled text comprehension characteristic of expert readers. We explain why phonics instruction is so central to learning in a writing system such as English. But we also move beyond phonics, reviewing research on what else children need to learn to become expert readers and considering how this might be translated into effective classroom practice. We call for an end to the reading wars and recommend an agenda for instruction and research in reading acquisition that is balanced, developmentally informed, and based on a deep understanding of how language and writing systems work.},

Nevertheless, some dyslexic adults successfully manage to study at university level, although very little is currently known about how they achieve this. The present study investigated at both the individual and group levels, whether the development of another oral language skill, namely, morphological knowledge, can be preserved and dissociated from the development of phonological knowledge. Reading, phonological, and morphological abilities were measured in 20 dyslexic and 20 non-dyslexic university students. The results confirmed the persistence of deficits in phonological but not morphological abilities, thereby revealing a dissociation in the development of these two skills. Moreover, the magnitude of the dissociation correlated with reading level. The outcome supports the claim that university students with dyslexia may compensate for phonological weaknesses by drawing on morphological knowledge in reading.},

In this review we shall consider some of the factors that affect our abilities to match unfamiliar faces. Major differences in orientation (e.g. inversion) or greyscale information (e.g. negation) affect face processing dramatically, and such effects suggest that representations derived from unfamiliar faces are based on relatively low-level image descriptions. Consistent with this, even relatively minor differences in lighting and viewpoint create problems for human face matching, leading to potentially important problems for the use of images from security videos. The relationships between different parts of the face (its `configuration') are as important to the impression created of an upright face as the local features themselves, suggesting further constraints on the representations derived from faces. We go on to consider the contribution of computer face-recognition systems to the understanding of the theory and the practical problems of face identification. Finally, we look to the future of research in this area that will incorporate motion and 3-D shape information.},

This article supports that hypothesis with evidence from syntax, lexical semantics, \& morphology. Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language (ABSL) is a new language that is compositional down to its smallest pieces, in which these pieces are lexemes. ABSL shows that a language can emerge very quickly in which lexemes are basic. Next comes evidence against the claim that newly derived words diverge from compositionality only because they are stored in memory. Finally, Hebrew verb roots are shown to have robust morphological properties that bear no relation to meaning \& little to phonology, leaving room for morphemes within a lexeme-based framework, but not as the basic meaningful atoms of language.

The characteristics, contexts, and conditions of learners and learning are discussed. Evidence from a variety of models and frames of reference in beginning reading research is presented, including cognitive, instructional, and educational psychology; linguistics; and special education. Four areas of convergence from the studies reviewed are identified, with implications for word recognition: reading comprehension is dependent on strong word recognition skills; strong word recognition requires understanding that words can be spoken or written, print corresponds to speech, and words are composed of phonemes; alphabetic understanding facilitates word recognition; and phonological recoding combined with word frequency mediates word recognition.

In Experiment 1 (n = 40), decision latencies for both types of prefixes were facilitated when real prefixed target words were preceded by real prefixed prime words, although the size of the priming effect for low-consistency prefixes was similar in size to that for orthographic controls. In Experiment 2 (n = 40), real prefixed target words were preceded by pseudoprefixed prime words. Facilitation in performance remained for high-consistency prefixes but was absent for low-consistency prefixes. These results support models of morphological processing that are sensitive to the statistical nature of the relationships between orthographic and semantic representations in a language.

  abstract = {Multichannel recordings are commonly presented as topographic maps series displaying the change of the potential distribution over time. When reviewing a sequence of potential maps it becomes obvious that there are epochs with only little activity (few field lines; small extrema values) while at other times the fields display high peaks and deep troughs with steep gradients. The measure of global field power (GFP) corresponds to the spatial standard deviation, and it quantifies the amount of activity at each time point in the field considering the data from all recording electrodes simultaneously resulting in a reference-independent descriptor of the potential field. Global field power is plotted as a function of time, and the occurrence times of GFP maxima are used to determine the latencies of evoked potential components. The topographical change occurring in subsequent potential field distributions may also be quantified by computing an index of global dissimilarity. Global field power and global dissimilarity show a complementary behavior over time: in general, high GFP is associated with similar fields while during periods between GFP peaks the topographic patterns of successive field distributions change rapidly accompanied by high dissimilarity values. The topographic changes, however, are best recognized by a segmentation procedure that considers field structure independent of GFP and global dissimilarity. The principles and practical applications of GFP computation, component latency determination and global dissimilarity of potential field distributions as well as a topographical time segmentation procedure will be illustrated with multichannel data evoked by visual stimuli.},

In older adults, N400 ERP studies have shown less efficient use of context compared to younger adults. Here, we asked whether the mechanisms underlying the N400 effect are the same in terms of predictiveness and congruency in younger and older adults. We used a simple picture-word matching task in which we crossed predictiveness and congruency. Our results indicate a three-way interaction between predictiveness, congruency, and age, in that, younger adults showed an N400 effect only in strongly constrained conditions; whereas, older adults showed an effect in both strongly- and weakly constrained conditions. This interaction was not modulated by language experience or cognitive decline. Our results support either two separate mechanisms (lexical access and integration) that run in parallel and are modulated by age or a common prediction error mechanism that changes with age.},

Aristotle's ``comparison theory'' holds that metaphors are elliptical similes: ``Sam is a pig'' is simply a short form of ``Sam is like a pig.'' In contrast, it has been suggested that metaphors cannot be elliptical similes because metaphors are ``stronger'' than similes. We know metaphors are stronger, it is argued, because of examples involving corrections, such as ``Peter is not just like a rock, he is a rock.'' The argument from corrections can be challenged on logical and empirical grounds. The ability to correct a simile with a metaphor does not entail that metaphors are stronger than similes when used on their own, which is likely to be the most frequent case. Although four experiments indicate that when corrections are involved, metaphors are indeed stronger than similes in several respects, alas a further four experiments indicate that these differences are largely eliminated when metaphors and similes are used on their own. We note that this pattern of results is consistent with the comparison theory, and we offer an explanation of the effects of corrections.},

This study reviews the sample size guideline for Cronbach's alpha test. Methods Manual sample size calculation using Microsoft Excel software and sample size tables were tabulated based on a single coefficient alpha and the comparison of two coefficients alpha. Results For a single coefficient alpha test, the approach by assuming the Cronbach's alpha coefficient equals to zero in the null hypothesis will yield a smaller sample size of less than 30 to achieve a minimum desired effect size of 0.7. However, setting the coefficient of Cronbach's alpha larger than zero in the null hypothesis could be necessary and this will yield larger sample size. For comparison of two coefficients of Cronbach's alpha, a larger sample size is needed when testing for smaller effect sizes. Conclusions In the assessment of the internal consistency of an instrument, the present study proposed the Cronbach's alpha's coefficient to be set at 0.5 in the null hypothesis and hence larger sample size is needed. For comparison of two coefficients' of Cronbach's alpha, justification is needed whether testing for extremely low and extremely large effect sizes are scientifically necessary.},

All three experiments revealed strong facilitation of picture naming due to morphologically related distractors. Form-related distractors facilitated picture naming in the immediate variant only, and to a lesser degree than compounds. Interestingly, the size of the morphemic effect was almost identical for semantically transparent and opaque complex words, which suggests that they share morphemic representations. These results suggest that morphological complexity in speech production is coded at the level of form representations, independent of semantic transparency.

Middle school students participating in school-to-home hands-on energy monitoring activities are compared to middle school and high school students in a different project taking part in activities such as an after-school robotics program. Both groups are compared and contrasted with a third group of high school students admitted at the eleventh grade to an academy of mathematics and science. All students were assessed using the same science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) dispositions instrument. Findings indicate that the after-school group whose participants self-selected STEM engagement activities, and the self-selected academy of mathematics and science group, each had highly positive STEM dispositions comparable to those of STEM professionals, while a subset of the middle school whole-classroom energy monitoring group that reported high interest in STEM as a career, also possessed highly positive STEM dispositions comparable to the STEM Professionals group. The authors conclude that several different kinds of hands-on STEM engagement activities are likely to foster or maintain positive STEM dispositions at the middle school and high school levels, and that these highly positive levels of dispositions can be viewed as a target toward which projects seeking to interest mainstream secondary students in STEM majors in college and STEM careers, can hope to aspire.

On a dual-system view, the productive -ed-suffixation of English regular past tense forms (e.g., look-looked) depends upon the mental grammar, whereas irregular forms (e.g., dig-dug) are retrieved from lexical memory. On a single-mechanism view, the computation of both past tense types depends on associative memory. Neurological double dissociations between regulars and irregulars strengthen the duaNSl-system view. The computation of real and novel, regular and irregular past tense forms was investigated in 20 aphasic subjects. Aphasics with non-fluent agrammatic speech and left frontal lesions were consistently more impaired at the production, reading, and judgment of regular than irregular past tenses. Aphasics with fluent speech and word-finding difficulties, and with left temporal/temporo-parietal lesions, showed the opposite pattern. These patterns held even when measures of frequency, phonological complexity, articulatory difficulty, and other factors were held constant. The data support the view that the memorized words of the mental lexicon are subserved by a brain system involving left temporal/temporo-parietal structures, whereas aspects of the mental grammar, in particular the computation of regular morphological forms, are subserved by a distinct system involving left frontal structures.

Despite the fact that all three models are reasonably successful, we argue that productivity in language is more insightfully captured through learnability than by rules or probabilities. Using a combination of computational modelling and behavioural experimentation we show that the basic principle of error-driven learning allows language users to detect relevant patterns of any degree of systematicity. In case of allomorphy, these patterns are found at a level that cuts across phonology and morphology and is not considered by mainstream approaches to language. Our findings thus highlight how a learning-based approach applies to phenomena on the continuum from rule-based over probabilistic to ``unruly'' and constrains our inferences about the types of structures that should be targeted on a cognitively realistic account of allomorphic representation.},

Ss in 2 experiments made lexical-decision judgments; those in Exp III pronounced the words used in the lexical-decision task; and those in Exp IV quickly pronounced their 1st associative response to the words. Differences in lexical access time for the words were measured with the pronunciation task, and differences in meaning were assessed with the association task. Multiple regression analyses of lexical-decision RT were conducted using associative RT, pronunciation RT, and other target word properties (printed frequency, length, instance dominance, and number of dictionary meanings) as predictor variables. These analyses revealed a relationship between lexical-decision RT and associative RT after the effects of other variables had been partialed out. Word frequency continued to have a significant relationship to lexical-decision RT beyond that shared with pronunciation RT and the other variables. Results indicate that at least some of the effect of word meaning and word frequency in lexical decision is attributable to a decision stage following lexical access.

The effects of morphological regularity were found to crucially depend on the time course of lexical access. Moreover, morphological regularity was found to affect nouns and verbs differentially.

In Experiment 1, participants described a series of pictures previously used in studies of cortical aphasic patients. The cerebellar patients did not differ significantly from the controls in the total number of words produced or in the proportion of closed-class words. They did differ to a marginally significant extent in the production of required articles. In Experiment 2, participants identified the agent in a series of aurally presented sentences in which three agency cues (subject-verb agreement, word order, and noun animacy) were manipulated. The cerebellar patients were less affected than the controls were by the manipulation of subject-verb agreement to a marginally significant extent. In Experiment 3, participants performed a grammaticality judgment task on a series of aurally presented sentences. The cerebellar patients were significantly less able to discriminate grammatical and ungrammatical sentences than the controls were, particularly when the error was of subject verb agreement as opposed to word order. The results suggest that damage to the cerebellum can result in subtle impairments in the use of grammatical morphology, and are discussed in light of hypothesized roles for the cerebellum in language.

Theory of mind is broadly defined as the ability to understand others' mental states, for example emotions, beliefs and desires. This book expands the study of theory of mind to look at the role language plays in the development of a child's theory of mind and whether language development is crucial to theory of mind ability. The book is organized into four parts and in total, there are 15 chapters. This is an academic book which presents and discusses the importance of the contributors' research findings in this area. The volume achieves its aims and is well written and edited but it is not a book that will help practitioners to facilitate either language or theory of mind development.

Data from two-stage midterm and final examinations are used to assess the extent to which individuals improve their performance when collaborating with other students. On average, the group (stage 2) score was about one standard deviation above the individual (stage 1) score. While this difference cannot be interpreted as the causal effect of two-stage examinations on learning, it suggests that individuals experienced substantial performance gains when working in groups in an examination. This average performance gain was comparable with the average difference between the top performer of the group in stage 1 and the group's stage 1 average, and was equivalent to about two-thirds of the difference between the ``super student'' score (i.e. the sum of the maximum score for each question in stage 1) and the group's stage 1 average. This last result suggests that group collaboration takes substantial (albeit partial) advantage of the aggregate knowledge and skills of the group's individual members. Student feedback about their experience with two-stage examinations reveal that that these types of examinations are generally perceived to be more helpful for learning and are less stressful than traditional examinations. Finally, using data on group gender compositions, we investigate the potential role of gender dynamics on group efficiency.},

  abstract = {In an investigation of the event-related potential (ERP) waveform and brain-behavior connections in beginning readers, first grade girls were shown first presentations and immediate repetitions of concrete and abstract known words (e.g., doll, bad), unknown words (e.g., loll ), difficult words (e.g., doubt), and nonwords (e.g., lllo) in list form as ERPs were recorded. Participants were divided into low-ability and high-ability reading groups based on scores on standardized reading tests. High-ability readers had larger N100s to unfamiliar stimuli, implying more attention paid to more difficult stimuli for this group. Alternately, the P200 was larger for low-ability readers, implying more perceptual preprocessing for this group. Low-ability readers also lacked a substantial N400, while high-ability readers evidenced a widely-distributed N400 to all types of stimuli, implying differential postlexical processing between groups. Although the effect of repetition was not significant during the N400 epoch, the ERP repetition effect during the 600-1000 ms epoch was such that repetitions were more positive than first presentations. Across subjects, known and difficult words elicited a repetition effect, while only known words elicited the effect for high-ability readers, and there was no effect for low-ability readers. There was also no concreteness effect for low-ability readers, although abstract and concrete words elicited differential processing in high-ability readers. Overall, the findings suggest that the fledgling word-processing system is more flexible and open to linguistic possibility than the fluent system, and that the N400 can serve as an index of this developmental difference. Moreover, the N400 may serve as an oblique index of the automaticity of lower-level processes that theoretically contribute to the higher-level integration process which the N400 represents.

This reversal is attributed to the high token frequencies with which pseudo-prefixed words occur. We also briefly discuss and compare the lexical statistics of a similar model in which obligatory segmentation takes place, the metrical segmentation theory proposed by Cutler and Norris (1988).

In addition, behavioral accuracy and reaction time improved with increasing age.

  abstract = {Five theories of how letter position is coded are contrasted: position-specific slot-coding, Wickelcoding, open-bigram coding (discrete and continuous), and spatial coding. These theories make different predictions regarding the relative similarity of three different types of pairs of letter strings: substitution neighbors, neighbors-once-removed, and double-substitution neighbors. In Experiment 1, we used an illusory word paradigm and found that neighbor-once-removed similarity contexts resulted in fewer illusory word reports than substitution neighbors but more illusory words than double-substitution neighbors. In Experiments 2 and 3, we used a masked form priming technique with a lexical-decision task.

We review the evidence for a specialized ``visual word form area'' and critically examine some of the arguments recently placed against this hypothesis. Three distinct forms of specialization must be distinguished: functional specialization, reproducible localization, and regional selectivity. Examination of the literature with this theoretical division in mind indicates that reading activates a precise subpart of the left ventral occipitotemporal sulcus, and that patients with pure alexia consistently exhibit lesions of this region (reproducible localization). Second, this region implements processes adequate for reading in a specific script, such as invariance across upper- and lower-case letters, and its lesion results in the selective loss of reading-specific processes (functional specialization). Third, the issue of regional selectivity, namely, the existence of putative cortical patches dedicated to letter and word recognition, cannot be resolved by positron emission tomography or lesion data, but requires high-resolution neuroimaging techniques. The available evidence from single-subject fMRI and intracranial recordings suggests that some cortical sites respond preferentially to letter strings than to other categories of visual stimuli such as faces or objects, though the preference is often relative rather than absolute. We conclude that learning to read results in the progressive development of an inferotemporal region increasingly responsive to visual words, which is aptly named the visual word form area (VWFA).},

For stimuli displayed in the left visual field, this transfer proceeds from the right to the left hemisphere through the posterior portion of the corpus callosum. In order to characterize the spatial and temporal organization of these processes, reading tasks with split-field presentation were performed by five control subjects and by two patients suffering from left hemialexia following posterior callosal lesions. The subjects' responses were studied using behavioural measures and functional brain imaging techniques, providing both high spatial resolution (functional MRI, fMRI) and high temporal resolution (high-density event-related potentials, ERPs). Early visual processing was revealed as activations contralateral to stimulation, located by fMRI in the inferior occipitotemporal region and presumably coincident with area V4. A negative wave occurring 150\textendash 160 ms post-stimulus, also strictly contralateral to stimulation, was recorded over posterior electrodes. In contrast with these hemifield-dependent effects, the VWF system was revealed as a strictly left-hemispheric activation which, in control subjects, was identical for stimuli presented in the left or in the right hemifield and was located in the middle portion of the left fusiform gyrus. The electrical signature of the VWF system consisted of a unilateral sharp negativity, recorded 180\textendash 200 ms post-stimulus over left inferior temporal electrodes. In callosal patients, due to the inability of visual information to pass across the posterior part of the corpus callosum, the VWF system was activated only by stimuli presented in the right visual field. Similarly, a significant influence of the word/non-word status on ERPs recorded over the left hemisphere was discernible for either hemifield in controls, while it affected only right-hemifield stimuli in callosal patients. These findings provide direct support for the main components of the classical model of reading and help specify their timing and cerebral substrates.},

The principle for determining BOSS is based on both orthographic and morphological factors. Exps I and II demonstrated that words are disrupted more when a division is made in the word according to its pronunciation than when it is made according to its BOSS. Exp III showed that final silent E's are not a part of the lexical representations of words, and this is predicted by the BOSS. Exps IV and V provide evidence for a parsing procedure for retrieval that is a reiterative left-to-right technique whereby lexical searches are made for combinations of letters that begin with the initial letter of the word. Overall results support a system of lexical access that is not mediated by phonological encoding. (18 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2002 APA, all rights reserved).},

Here, we measured event-related brain potentials to visual sequences designed to elicit inferential processing. In Impoverished sequences, an expressionless ``onlooker'' watches an undepicted event (e.g., person throws a ball for a dog, then watches the dog chase it) just prior to a surprising finale (e.g., someone else returns the ball), which should lead to an inference (i.e., the different person retrieved the ball). Implied sequences alter this narrative structure by adding visual cues to the critical panel such as a surprised facial expression to the onlooker implying they saw an unexpected, albeit undepicted, event. In contrast, Expected sequences show a predictable, but then confounded, event (i.e., dog retrieves ball, then different person returns it), and Explicit sequences depict the unexpected event (i.e., different person retrieves then returns ball). At the critical penultimate panel, sequences representing depicted events (Explicit, Expected) elicited a larger posterior positivity (P600) than the relatively passive events of an onlooker (Impoverished, Implied), though Implied sequences were slightly more positive than Impoverished sequences. At the subsequent and final panel, a posterior positivity (P600) was greater to images in Impoverished sequences than those in Explicit and Implied sequences, which did not differ. In addition, both sequence types requiring inference (Implied, Impoverished) elicited a larger frontal negativity than those explicitly depicting events (Expected, Explicit). These results show that neural processing differs for visual narratives omitting events versus those depicting events, and that the presence of subtle visual cues can modulate such effects presumably by altering narrative structure.},

In Experiment 2, we used non-morphological pseudowords such as rapiduit, where -uit is an existing ending in French, but is not a suffix. In Experiment 3, primes were pseudowords consisting of a non-interpretable combination of roots and suffixes, such as sportation, formed by the noun sport "sport" and the suffix -ation (-ation only attaches to verbs). Results of Experiment 1 show that morphologically complex pseudowords significantly facilitated the recognition of their roots. This priming effect was equivalent to the facilitation obtained when existing derived words were used as primes. In Experiment 2, no priming effect was obtained with non-morphological pseudowords, demonstrating that the mere occurrence of the target at the beginning of the pseudoword prime is not sufficient to produce any priming and that an orthographic account of the results is not viable. Finally, Experiment 3 shows that the semantic interpretability of the morphologically complex pseudowords does not affect priming, as facilitation effect is obtained with morphologically complex non-interpretable pseudowords. The results reveal an early morphological decomposition triggered by the morphological structure of the prime, but insensitive to its lexicality or interpretability.

  abstract = {Two experiments tested the hypothesis that orthographic overlap can affect word retrieval through inhibition and facilitation, analogous to effects observed in visual word recognition. Young and older adult participants rated a list of words for pleasantness, where the initial three letters of each word were orthographically identical for three words in the list (shared orthography) or were orthographically unique, shared by no other words in the list (unshared orthography). Word retrieval was assessed either explicitly via cued recall or implicitly via a word-stem completion test. Response times (RTs) were recorded in addition to the degree of correct recall and repetition priming, the standard retrieval measures in these tests. In explicit retrieval, orthographic overlap had no significant effect on RT, whereas correct cued recall was greater for words with shared orthography than for words with unshared orthography, and this increase in recall was the same for both age groups. There were age differences on both dependent measures, with older adults having slower RTs to recall words and less recall than young adults. In implicit retrieval, orthographic overlap significantly facilitated completion of word stems for both measures, evidenced by faster RTs and more repetition priming of shared orthography words than unshared orthography words, and these facilitation effects did not vary by age. Further, there were no overall age differences in RTs or in amount of repetition priming. Results suggest that orthographic overlap can facilitate word retrieval depending on the nature and measure of the retrieval. Both age and orthographic overlap dissociate implicit and explicit word retrieval, and these dissociations may be useful in clarifying theories of implicit and explicit memory and their relationships to language.

The DRC is a computational realization of the dual-route theory of reading, and is the only computational model of reading that can perform the 2 tasks most commonly used to study reading: lexical decision and reading aloud. For both tasks, the authors show that a wide variety of variables that influence human latencies influence the DRC model's latencies in exactly the same way. The DRC model simulates a number of such effects that other computational models of reading do not, but there appear to be no effects that any other current computational model of reading can simulate but that the DRC model cannot. The authors conclude that the DRC model is the most successful of the existing computational models of reading.},

  abstract = {It has often been argued that various facts about skilled reading aloud cannot be explained by any model unless that model possesses a dual-route architecture (lexical and nonlexical routes from print to speech). This broad claim has been challenged by M. S. Seidenberg and J. L. McClelland (1989, 1990). Their model has but a single route from print to speech, yet, they contend, it can account for major facts about reading that have hitherto been claimed to require a dual-route architecture. The authors identify 6 of these major facts about reading. The 1-route model proposed by Seidenberg and McClelland can account for the 1st of these but not the remaining 5. Because models with dual-route architectures can explain all 6 of these basic facts about reading, the authors suggest that this remains the viable architecture for any tenable model of skilled reading and learning to read. The dual-route cascaded model, a computational version of the dual-route model, is described.},

This Chapter is dedicated to the methodology of analyzing and quantifying ERPs in general. Basic models (additive, phase modulation and resetting, potential asymmetry) that account for the generation of ERPs are discussed. The principles and requirements of ensemble time averaging are presented, along with several uni-and multi-variate methods that have been proposed to improve the averaging procedure: wavelet decomposition and denoising, spatial, temporal and spatio-temporal filtering, with special emphasis on the basic concepts of Principal Component Analysis, (PCA) Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) and Blind Source Separation (BSS), including Independent Component Analysis (ICA). Special consideration is given to a number of practical questions related to the averaging procedure: overlapping ERPs, correcting inter-sweep latency and amplitude variability, alternative averaging methods (e.g., median) and the estimation of ERP onset. Some specific aspects of ERP analysis in the frequency domain (for ex., SSVEPS) are briefly surveyed, along with topographic analysis, statistical testing and classification methods. Frequency and time-frequency methods of ERP analysis are detailed in Ch. 44.},

Comparisons 4 and 5 showed that the syllable frequency effect does not result from a confound with the frequency of letter or phoneme clusters at the beginning of words. The syllable frequency effect was shown to diminish with increasing word frequency in Comparison 6.

Norris and Kinoshita's (2008) Bayesian reader account of masked priming explains this pattern based on the same principle as that explaining the absence of priming for nonwords in the lexical decision task. The pattern of priming follows from the way the model makes optimal decisions in the two tasks; priming does not depend on first activating the prime and then the target. An alternative explanation is in terms of a bias towards responding ``same'' that exactly counters the facilitatory effect of lexical access. The present study tested these two views by varying both the degree to which the prime predicts the response and the visibility of the prime. Unmasked primes produced effects expected from the view that priming is influenced by the degree to which the prime predicts the response. In contrast, with masked primes, the size of priming for the same response was completely unaffected by predictability. These results rule out response bias as an explanation of the absence of masked priming for different responses and, in turn, indicate that masked priming is not a consequence of automatic lexical access of the prime.},

If syllabic effects prove to be independent from orthographic redundancy, this would seriously challenge the ability of current computational models to account for the processing of polysyllabic words. Three experiments are presented to disentangle effects of the frequency of syllabic units and orthographic segments in lexical decision. In Experiment 1 the authors obtained an inhibitory syllable frequency effect that was unaffected by the presence or absence of a bigram trough at the syllable boundary. In Experiments 2 and 3 an inhibitory effect of initial syllable frequency but a facilitative effect of initial bigram frequency emerged when manipulating 1 of the 2 measures and controlling for the other in Spanish words starting with consonant-vowel syllables. The authors conclude that effects of syllable frequency and letter-cluster frequency are independent and arise at different processing levels of visual word recognition. Results are discussed within the framework of an interactive activation model of visual word recognition. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

However, little is known about how these visual social cues are integrated over time in the brain and, notably, whether this binding occurs in the emotional or the motor system. By coupling magnetic resonance and electroencephalography imaging in humans, we were able to show that, 200 ms after stimulus onset, the premotor cortex integrated gaze, gesture, and emotion displayed by a congener. At earlier stages, emotional content was processed independently in the amygdala (170 ms), whereas directional cues (gaze direction with pointing gesture) were combined at {$\sim$}190 ms in the parietal and supplementary motor cortices. These results demonstrate that the early binding of visual social signals displayed by an agent engaged the dorsal pathway and the premotor cortex, possibly to facilitate the preparation of an adaptive response to another person's immediate intention.},

Participants were exposed to statistically governed input sequences and then tested on their ability to classify novel items. We explored three types of presentation formats\textemdash visual input distributed spatially, visual input distributed temporally, auditory input distributed temporally\textemdash and two rates of presentation: moderate (4 elements/second) and fast (8 elements/second). Overall, learning abilities were best for visual-spatial and auditory input. Additionally, at the faster presentation rate, performance declined only for the visual-temporal condition. Finally, auditory learning was mediated by increased sensitivity to the endings of input sequences, whereas vision was most sensitive to the beginnings of sequences. These results suggest that statistical learning for sequential and spatial patterns proceeds differently across the visual and auditory modalities.},

However, this structural decomposition of the word does not directly give us a semantic representation of the word's meaning. Since morphology obeys the principle of compositionality, the semantics of the word can be systematically derived from the meaning of its parts. In this work, we propose a novel probabilistic model of word formation that captures both the analysis of a word w into its constituents segments and the synthesis of the meaning of w from the meanings of those segments. Our model jointly learns to segment words into morphemes and compose distributional semantic vectors of those morphemes. We experiment with the model on English CELEX data and German DerivBase (Zeller et al., 2013) data. We show that jointly modeling semantics increases both segmentation accuracy and morpheme F1 by between 3\% and 5\%. Additionally, we investigate different models of vector composition, showing that recurrent neural networks yield an improvement over simple additive models. Finally, we study the degree to which the representations correspond to a linguist's notion of morphological productivity.},

ERPs measured from 300 to 500 msec after the onset of the sentence-final words differed as a function of metaphoricity: Literal endings elicited the smallest N400, metaphors the largest N400, whereas literal mappings elicited an N400 of intermediate amplitude. Metaphoric endings also elicited a larger posterior positivity than did either literal or literal mapping words.

To assess hemispheric differences in pun comprehension, visually presented probes that were either highly related (COW), moderately related (LEG), or unrelated, were presented in either the left or right visual half field (LVF/RVF). The sensitivity of each hemisphere to the different meanings evoked by the pun was assessed by ERP relatedness effects with presentation to the LVF and the RVF. In Experiment 1, the inter-stimulus interval between the pun and the onset of the visual probe was 0 ms; in Experiment 2, this value was 500ms. In Experiment 1, both highly and moderately related probes elicited similar priming effects with RVF presentation. Relative to their unrelated counterparts, related probes elicited less negative ERPs in the N400 interval (300\textendash 600ms post-onset), and more positive ERPs 600\textendash 900ms post-onset, suggesting both meanings of the pun were equally active in the left hemisphere. LVF presentation yielded similar priming effects (less negative N400 and a larger positivity thereafter) for the highly related probes, but no effects for moderately related probes. In Experiment 2, similar N400 priming effects were observed for highly and moderately related probes presented to both visual fields. Compared to unrelated probes 600\textendash 900ms post-onset, related probes elicited a centro-parietal positivity with RVF presentation, but a fronto-polar positivity with LVF presentation. Results suggest that initially, the different meanings evoked by a pun are both active in the left hemisphere, but only the most highly related meaning is active in the right hemisphere. By 500ms, both meanings are active in both hemispheres.},

Word identities are defined by 3 interlinked constituents (orthographic, phonological, and semantic). The implemented model simulates the time course of graphic, phonological, and semantic priming effects, including immediate graphic facilitation followed by graphic inhibition with simultaneous phonological facilitation, a pattern unique to the Chinese writing system. Pseudocharacter primes produced only facilitation, supporting the model's assumption that lexical thresholds determine phonological and semantic, but not graphic, effects.

We use affixation of verbal and nominal roots as an indicator of morphological complexity. In the 2 studies described here, we focus first on how the complexity of morphological affixation in CDS relates to the particular language the maternal caregivers are speaking, and second on how these properties of CDS are reflected in the morphological complexity of the children's language. Ss in Study 1 were 4 White mothers, 3 Inuit mothers, and one grandmother who lived with a younger mother; their children were aged 1.6\textendash 2.1 yrs old. Ss in Study 2 were 3 Inukitut-speaking boys (aged 1.8\textendash 2.7 yrs). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (chapter)},

Recent masked priming studies support models that assume early decomposition of (potentially) morphologically complex words. The electrophysiological evidence, however, is inconsistent. We combined masked morphological priming with magneto-encephalography (MEG), a technique particularly adept at indexing processes involved in lexical access. The latency of an MEG component peaking, on average, 220 msec post-onset of the target in left occipito-temporal brain regions was found to be sensitive to the morphological prime\textendash target relationship under masked priming conditions in a visual lexical decision task. Shorter latencies for related than unrelated conditions were observed both for semantically transparent (cleaner\textendash CLEAN) and opaque (corner\textendash CORN) prime\textendash target pairs, but not for prime\textendash target pairs with only an orthographic relationship (brothel\textendash BROTH). These effects are likely to reflect a prelexical level of processing where form-based representations of stems and affixes are represented and are in contrast to models positing no morphological structure in lexical representations. Moreover, we present data regarding the transitional probability from stem to affix in a post hoc comparison, which suggests that this factor may modulate early morphological decomposition, particularly for opaque words. The timing of a robust MEG component sensitive to the morphological relatedness of prime\textendash target pairs can be used to further understand the neural substrates and the time course of lexical processing.

Being insensitive to semantic factors, this morpho-orthographic segmentation process cannot capture the morphological relationship between irregularly inflected words and their base forms (e.g., fell,\"A\`ifall, bought,\"A\`ibuy); hence, the prediction follows that these words should not facilitate each other in masked priming experiments. However, the first experiment described in the present work demonstrates that fell does facilitate fall more than orthographically matched (e.g., fill) and unrelated control words (e.g., hope). Experiments 2 and 3 also show that this effect cannot be explained through orthographic sub-regularities that characterize many irregular inflections, as no priming arose when unrelated words showing the same orthographic patterns were tested (e.g., tell,\"A\`itall vs. toll,\"A\`itall). These results highlight the existence of a second higher-level source of masked morphological priming; we propose that this second source of priming is located at the lemma level, where inflected words (but not derived words) share their representation irrespective of orthographic regularity.

In a new take on this issue, we show that prime nonwords facilitate lexical decisions to target words ending with the same suffix (sheeter\textendash TEACHER) compared to a condition where the critical suffix was substituted by another one (sheetal\textendash TEACHER) or by an unrelated nonmorphological ending (sheetub\textendash{} TEACHER). We also show that this effect is genuinely morphological, as no priming emerged in noncomplex items with the same orthographic characteristics (sportel\textendash BROTHEL vs. sportic\textendash BROTHEL vs. sportur\textendash BROTHEL). In a further experiment, we took advantage of these results to assess whether suffixes are recognized in a position-specific fashion. Masked suffix priming did not emerge when the relative order of stems and suffixes was reversed in the prime nonwords\textemdash ersheet did not yield any time saving in the identification of teacher as compared to either alsheet or obsheet. We take these results to show that \textendash er was not identified as a morpheme in ersheet, thus indicating that suffix identification is position specific. This conclusion is in line with data on interference effects in nonword rejection and strongly constrains theoretical proposals on how complex words are identified. In particular, because these findings were reported in a masked priming paradigm, they suggest that positional constraints operate early, most likely at a prelexical level of morpho-orthographic analysis.},

Many previous studies document a decline in nonnative phonetic perception between 6 and 12 months of age. However, much less experimental attention has been paid to developmental change in native-language phonetic perception over the same time period. We hypothesized that language experience, in the first year facilitates native-language phonetic performance between 6 and 12 months of age. We tested 6-8- and 10-12-month-old infants in the United States and Japan to examine native and nonnative patterns of developmental change using the American English /r-l/ contrast. The goals of the experiment were to: (a) determine whether facilitation characterizes native-language phonetic change between 6 and 12 months of age, (b) examine the decline previously observed for nonnative contrasts and (c) test directional asymmetries for consonants. The results show a significant increase in performance for the native-language contrast in the first year, a decline in nonnative perception over the same time period, and indicate directional asymmetries that are constant across age and culture. We argue that neural commitment to native-language phonetic properties explains the pattern of developmental change in the first year. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

This fact raises the issue of how the word identification system codes for morpheme position, hence allowing it to distinguish between words like overhang and hangover, and to recognize that preheat is a word, whereas heatpre is not. Recent data have shown that suffixes are identified as morphemes only when they occur at the end of letter strings (Crepaldi, Rastle, \& Davis, 2010, ``Morphemes in Their Place: Evidence for Position-Specific Identification of Suffixes,'' Memory \& Cognition, 38, 312\textendash 321), which supports the general proposal that the word identification system is sensitive to morpheme positional constraints. This proposal leads to the prediction that the identification of free stems should occur in a position-independent fashion, given that free stems can occur anywhere within complex words (e.g., overdress and dresser). In Experiment 1, we show that the rejection time of transposed-constituent pseudocompounds (e.g., moonhoney) is longer than that of matched control nonwords (e.g., moonbasin), suggesting that honey and moon are identified within moonhoney, and that these morpheme representations activate the representation for the word honeymoon. In Experiments 2 and 3, we demonstrate that the masked presentation of transposed-constituent pseudocompounds (e.g., moonhoney) facilitates the identification of compound words (honeymoon). In contrast, monomorphemic control pairs do not produce a similar pattern (i.e., rickmave did not prime maverick), indicating that the effect for moonhoney pairs is genuinely morphological in nature. These results demonstrate that stem representations differ from affix representations in terms of their positional constraints, providing a challenge to all existing theories of morphological processing.

Dictionary calculations reveal that derived forms that are more frequent than their bases are significantly more likely to display symptoms of semantic drift than derived forms containing higher-frequency bases. High-frequency forms, however, are no more prone to semantic drift than low-frequency forms. These results provide evidence that it is relative frequency, rather than absolute frequency, that affects the decomposability of morphologically complex words. A low-frequency form is likely to be nontransparent if it is composed of even lower-frequency parts.

However, it has been proposed (Funnell, 1987) that morphological errors in deep dyslexia are not morphological in nature but are actually a type of visual error that arises when a target word that cannot be read aloud (by virtue of its low imageability and/or frequency) is modified to form a visually similar word that can be read aloud (by virtue of its higher imageability and/or frequency). In the work reported here, the deep dyslexic patient DE read aloud lists of genuinely suffixed words (e.g., killer), pseudosuffixed words (e.g., corner), and words with non-morphological embeddings (e.g., cornea). Results revealed that the morphological status of a word had a significant influence on the production of stem errors (i.e., errors that include the stem or pseudostem of the target): genuinely suffixed words yielded more stem errors than pseudosuffixed words or words with non-morphological embeddings. This effect of morphological status could not be attributed to the relative levels of target and stem imageability and/or frequency. We argue that this pattern of data indicates that apparent morphological errors in deep dyslexic reading are genuinely morphological, and discuss the implications of these errors for theories of deep dyslexia.

Injury to the frontal lobes had a limited impact on P3 amplitude an behavioral responses (viewing duration and reaction time [RT]) to target stimuli. A strong correlation was found between measures of apathy and both attenuated amplitude and viewing duration in response to novel, but not target, stimuli. Differences in amplitude of the novelty P3 response explained a large portion of the variance associated with duration of viewing of novel stimuli. After controlling for the influence of P3 amplitude, there was no association between frontal lobe injury and reduced viewing of novel stimuli.

  abstract = {Objectives: Electrical potentials produced by blinks and eye movements present serious problems for electroencephalographic (EEG) and event-related potential (ERP) data interpretation and analysis, particularly for analysis of data from some clinical populations. Often, all epochs contaminated by large eye artifacts are rejected as unusable, though this may prove unacceptable when blinks and eye movements occur frequently. Methods: Frontal channels are often used as reference signals to regress out eye artifacts, but inevitably portions of relevant EEG signals also appearing in EOG channels are thereby eliminated or mixed into other scalp channels. A generally applicable adaptive method for removing artifacts from EEG records based on blind source separation by independent component analysis (ICA) (Neural Computation 7 (1995) 1129; Neural Computation 10(8) (1998) 2103; Neural Computation 11(2) (1999) 606) overcomes these limitations. Results: Results on EEG data collected from 28 normal controls and 22 clinical subjects performing a visual selective attention task show that ICA can be used to effectively detect, separate and remove ocular artifacts from even strongly contaminated EEG recordings. The results compare favorably to those obtained using rejection or regression methods. Conclusions: The ICA method can preserve ERP contributions from all of the recorded trials and all the recorded data channels, even when none of the single trials are artifact-free.},

N2 elicited by an unusual background stimulus was larger than that evoked by simple, deviant stimuli, a pattern opposite that exhibited by the subsequent P3. Deviance from immediate context had limited influence over N2 amplitude. The results suggest that novelty N2 and novelty P3 reflect the processing of different aspects of 'novel' visual stimuli.

Each of these topics has psycholinguistic components that reflect the language foundations of reading.  These foundations lie in two facts: (1) a writing system connects to a linguistic system at one or more levels, meaning that word reading is partially a psycholinguistic process; and (2): reading comprehension shares processes (e.g., parsing) with general language comprehension.  One trend of recent research is the development of models of word identification that rely on single rather than dual mechanisms and their extension to explain reading difficulties.  Another is the conclusion that phonology plays a role in reading that cuts across writing systems.  Reading comprehension research continues to reflect two different traditions, sentence parsing and text comprehension.  Both show increasing influence of general cognitive explanations, as opposed to strictly linguistic explanations, for comprehension phenomena.  Studies of brain activation bring converging evidence on reading processes and provide neuroanatomical correlates of reading problems.  In one area, the acquisition and teaching of reading, advances come from increasing consolidation and practical use of previous research gains.},

Event-related potentials were recorded from well-matched frontal patients, parietal patients, and non-brain-injured subjects who controlled their viewing duration (by button press) of line drawings that included a frequent, repetitive background stimulus, an infrequent target stimulus, and infrequent, novel visual stimuli. Damage to the frontal cortex resulted in a much greater disruption of response to novel stimuli than to designated targets. Frontal patients exhibited a widely distributed, profound reduction of the novelty P3 response and a marked diminution of the viewing duration of novel events. In contrast, damage to posterior parietal lobes was associated with a substantial reduction of both target P3 and novelty P3 amplitude; however, there was less disruption of the processing of novel than of target stimuli. We conclude that two nodes of the neuroanatomical network for responding to and processing novelty are the prefrontal and posterior parietal regions, which participate in the voluntary allocation of attention to novel events.

Golgi developed the silver impregnation method for studying nerve cells, a technique that clearly showed entire cells with their arborizing dendrites and axons for the first time. Ramon y Cajal seized on the method for a series of groundbreaking studies that provided convincing support for what came to be known as the neuron theory, in opposition to the reigning model of the time, the reticular theory. The retina was one of Ramon y Cajal's favorite tissues for study. Although he was perplexed by the horizontal and amacrine cells, he was remarkably prescient in his analysis of retinal and CNS cellular anatomy. Few scientists have cast such a long shadow in their field, but Ramon y Cajal did not establish the neuron theory single-handedly, and the real tale is much more complicated.},

Each of the 3 experimental conditions included a frequent repetitive background stimulus and infrequent stimuli that deviated from the background stimulus. Deviant stimuli elicited larger N2-P3 amplitudes and longer viewing durations than the repetitive background stimulus, even when the deviant stimuli were simple, familiar shapes and the background stimulus was a highly unusual figure. Compared with simple, familiar deviant stimuli, unusual deviant stimuli elicited larger N2-P3 amplitudes and longer viewing times. Within Ss, the deviant stimuli that evoked the largest N2-P3 responses also elicited the longest viewing durations. Deviance from both immediate context and long-term prior experience contributes to the response to novelty, with the combination generating the largest N2-P3 amplitude and the most sustained attention. The amplitude of the N2-P3 may reflect how much "uncertainty" is evoked by a novel visual stimulus and signal the need for further exploration.

  abstract = {The self-teaching hypothesis proposes that phonological recoding functions as a self-teaching mechanism enabling the learner to independently acquire an autonomous orthographic lexicon. Successful decoding encounters with novel letter strings provide opportunities to learn word-specific print-to-meaning connections. Although it may not play a central role in skilled word recognition, phonological recoding, by virtue of its self-teaching function, is regarded as critical to successful reading acquisition. This paper elaborates the self-teaching hypothesis proposed by Jorm and Share (1983), and reviews relevant evidence. Key features of phonological recoding include an item-based rather than stage-based role in development, the progressive ``lexicalization'' of the process of recoding, and the importance of phonological awareness and contextual information in resolving decoding ambiguity. Although phonological skills have been shown to be primary in reading acquisition, orthographic processing appears to be an important but secondary source of individual differences. This implies an asymmetrical pattern of dissociations in both developmental and acquired reading disorders. Strong relationships between word recognition, basic phonological processing abilities and phonemic awareness are also consistent with the self-teaching notion. Finally, it is noted that current models of word recognition (both PDP and dual-route) fail to address the quintessential problem of reading acquisition - independent generation of target pronunciations for novel orthographic strings.},

The authors investigated the mechanisms underlying these changes by studying the novelty P3 response that measures shifts of attention toward novel events. While event-related potentials were recorded, 10 mildly impaired AD patients and 20 matched normal controls (NC) viewed line drawings that included a repetitive background stimulus, an infrequent target stimulus, and infrequent novel stimuli. Results showed that P3 amplitude to novel stimuli was significantly smaller for AD patients than NC. For NC, P3 response to novel stimuli was much larger than to background stimuli. Although NC spent more time looking at novel than background stimuli, patients with AD distributed their viewing time evenly. Remarkably, for patients with AD, the amplitude of the novelty P3 response powerfully predicted how long they would spend looking at novel stimuli and inversely correlated with apathy severity. The novelty P3 response is markedly diminished in mild AD, at a time when the target P3 response is preserved. The disruption of the novelty P3 response predicts diminished attention to novel stimuli and is associated with the apathy exhibited by patients with AD.

The prototypical example and best-characterized neurotrophic factor is nerve growth factor (NGF), which is widely recognized as a target-derived factor responsible for the survival and maintenance of the phenotype of specific subsets of peripheral neurons and basal forebrain cholinergic nuclei during development and maturation. In addition to being active in a wide array of non-nervous system cells, NGF is also synthesized by a range of cell types not considered as classical targets for innervation by NGF-dependent neurons; these include cells of the immune-haematopoietic lineage and populations in the brain involved in neuroendocrine functions. NGF concentrations are elevated in numerous inflammatory and autoimmune states such as multiple sclerosis, chronic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and mastocytosis, in conjunction with increased accumulation of mast cells. Intriguingly, NGF seems to be linked also with diabetic pathology and insulin homeostasis. Mast cells and NGF appear involved in neuroimmune interactions and tissue inflammation. As mast cells are capable of producing and responding to NGF, this suggests that alterations in mast cell behaviour could provoke maladaptive neuroimmune tissue responses, including those of an autoimmune nature. Moreover, NGF exerts a modulatory role on sensory nociceptive nerve physiology in the adult, which appears to correlate with hyperalgesic phenomena occurring in tissue inflammation. NGF can therefore be viewed as a multifactorial modulator of neuro\textendash immune\textendash endocrine functions.},

  abstract = {An important challenge in the design and analysis of event-related or single-trial functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments is to optimize statistical efficiency, i.e., the accuracy with which the event-related hemodynamic response to different stimuli can be estimated for a given amount of imaging time. Several studies have suggested that using a fixed inter-stimulus-interval (ISI) of at least 15 sec results in optimal statistical efficiency or power and that using shorter ISIs results in a severe loss of power. In contrast, recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of using ISIs as short as 500 ms while still maintaining considerable efficiency or power. Here, we attempt to resolve this apparent contradiction by a quantitative analysis of the relative efficiency afforded by different event-related experimental designs. This analysis shows that statistical efficiency falls off dramatically as the ISI gets sufficiently short, if the ISI is kept fixed for all trials. However, if the ISI is properly jittered or randomized from trial to trial, the efficiency improves monotonically with decreasing mean ISI. Importantly, the efficiency afforded by such variable ISI designs can be more than 10 times greater than that which can be achieved by fixed ISI designs. These results further demonstrate the feasibility of using identical experimental designs with fMRI and electro-/magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG) without sacrificing statistical power or efficiency of either technique, thereby facilitating comparison and integration across imaging modalities.

Predictability strongly affected the N400 component; the effect was stronger for low than for high-frequency words. The P200 frequency effect indicates that high-frequency words are lexically accessed very fast, independent of context information. Effects on the N400 suggest that predictability strongly moderates the late access especially of low-frequency words. Thus, contextual facilitation on the N400 appears to reflect both lexical and post-lexical stages of word recognition, questioning a strict classification into lexical and post-lexical processes.},

  abstract = {Scientific advances fuel American economic competitiveness, quality of life, and national security. Much of the future job growth is projected in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). However, the supply of domestic students who pursue STEM careers remains small relative to the demand. On the supply side, girls and women represent untapped human capital that, if leveraged, could enhance the STEM workforce, given that they comprise 50\% of the American population and more than 50\% of the college-bound population. Yet the scarcity of women in STEM careers remains stark. What drives these gender disparities in STEM? And what are the solutions? Research points to different answers depending on the stage of human development. Distinct obstacles occur during three developmental periods: (a) childhood and adolescence, (b) emerging adulthood, and (c) young-to-middle adulthood. This article describes how specific learning environments, peer relations, and family characteristics become obstacles to STEM interest, achievement, and persistence in each period. Evidence-based policies and programs promise to eliminate these obstacles, increasing girls and women?s participation in STEM.},

  abstract = {EEG correlates of a range of psycholinguistic word properties were used to investigate the time course of access to psycholinguistic information during visual word recognition. Neurophysiological responses recorded in a visual lexical decision task were submitted to linear regression analysis. First, 10 psycholinguistic features of each of 300 stimulus words were submitted to a principal component analysis, which yielded four orthogonal variables likely to reflect separable processes in visual word recognition: Word length, Letter n-gram frequency, Lexical frequency and Semantic coherence of a word's morphological family. Since the lexical decision task required subjects to distinguish between words and pseudowords, the binary variable Lexicality was also investigated using a factorial design. Word\textendash pseudoword differences in the event-related potential first appeared at 160 ms after word onset. However, regression analysis of EEG data documented a much earlier effect of both Word length and Letter n-gram frequency around 90 ms. Lexical frequency showed its earliest effect slightly later, at 110 ms, and Semantic coherence significantly correlated with neurophysiological measures around 160 ms, simultaneously with the lexicality effect. Source estimates indicated parieto-temporo-occipital generators for the factors Length, Letter n-gram frequency and Word frequency, but widespread activation with foci in left anterior temporal lobe and inferior frontal cortex related to Semantic coherence. At later stages (\&gt;200 ms), all variables exhibited simultaneous EEG correlates. These results indicate that information about surface form and meaning of a lexical item is first accessed at different times in different brain systems and then processed simultaneously, thus supporting cascaded interactive processing models.},

Irrespective of whether colour categories are taken to be universal (Berlin \& Kay, 1969) or language induced (Davidoff, Davies, \& Roberson, 1999), it is widely assumed that colour boundaries, and hence categorical similarity, would be used when categorising colours. However, we argue that categorical similarity is more reliably used in implicit than in explicit categorisation. Thus, in Experiment 1, we found that category boundaries may be overridden in the explicit task of matching-to-sample: There was a similar strong tendency to ignore colour boundaries and to divide the range of coloured stimuli into two equal groups in both Westerners and in a remote population (Himba). In Experiment 2, we showed that a distinctive stimulus (focal colour) in the range affected the equal division in a matching-to-sample task. Experiment 3 tested the stability of a category boundary in an implicit task (visual search) that assessed categorical perception; only for this task was categorisation largely immune to range effects and largely based on categorical similarity. It is concluded that, even after colour categories are acquired, perceptual rather than categorical similarity is commonly used in judgements of colour similarity.

I describe three alternative, non-symbolic approaches, each with a different emphasis but all using the same underlying computational model. This is a network of interacting computing units, a unit representing a nerve cell to a greater or lesser degree of fidelity in the different approaches. Computational neuroscience emphasizes the development and functioning of the nervous system; the approach of neural networks examines new algorithms for specific applications in, for example, pattern recognition and classification; according to the sub-symbolic approach, concepts are built up of entities called sub-symbols, which are the activities of individual processing units in a neural network. A frequently debated question is whether theories formulated at the subsymbolic level are `mere implementations' of symbolic ones. I describe recent work due to Foster, who proposes that it is valid to view a system at many different levels of description and that, whereas any theory may have many different implementations, in general sub-symbolic theories may not be implementations of symbolic ones.},

Participants sorted a representative set of 65 colors into N groups (where N ranged from 2 to 12) based on their perceptual similarity. We assessed the similarities and differences among the choices of the 3 language samples, and focused in particular on 2 more specific questions. First, we tested the conjecture that levels of consensus over which tiles to group together should peak when N equalled the number of basic color terms in the language. Second, we focused on possible linguistic influences on color grouping in the GREEN-BLUE region of color space. Setswana uses a single term for this region, whereas English uses 2 terms and Russian uses 3 terms. The most striking feature of the results was the marked similarity of the groups chosen across the 3 language samples. In addition there were small but reliable differences in grouping associated with linguistic differences. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Our systematic review and meta-analysis combined 113 effect sizes from 75 studies to estimate the magnitude of gender-related differences in toy preferences. We also assessed the impact of using different toys or methods to assess these differences, as well as the effect of age on gender-related toy preferences. Boys preferred boy-related toys more than girls did, and girls preferred girl-related toys more than boys did. These differences were large (d\,{$\geq$}\,1.60). Girls also preferred toys that researchers classified as neutral more than boys did (d\,=\,0.29). Preferences for gender-typical over gender-atypical toys were also large and significant (d\,{$\geq$}\,1.20), and girls and boys showed gender-related differences of similar magnitude. When only dolls and vehicles were considered, within-sex differences were even larger and of comparable size for boys and girls. Researchers sometimes misclassified toys, perhaps contributing to an apparent gender difference in preference for neutral toys. Forced choice methods produced larger gender-related differences than other methods, and gender-related differences increased with age.},

We explored the neural systems involved in processing different word classes in a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging study, contrasting four groups of words co-varying morphological complexity (simple, monomorphemic words vs complex derived or inflected words) and syntactic class (verbs vs nouns/adjectives). Subtraction of word from letter string processing showed activation in left frontal and temporal lobe regions consistent with prior studies of visual word processing. No differences were observed for morphologically complex and simple words, despite adequate power to detect stimulus specific effects.

  abstract = {The processing of English noun-noun compounds (NNCs) was investigated to identify the extent and nature of differences between the performance of native speakers of English and advanced Spanish and German non-native speakers of English. The study sought to establish whether the word order of the equivalent structure in the non-native speakers' mothertongue (L1) had an influence on their processing of NNCs in their second language (L2), and whether this influence was due to differences in grammatical representation (i.e., incomplete acquisition of the relevant structure) or processing effects. Two mask-primed lexical decision experiments were conducted in which compounds were presented with their constituent nouns in licit vs. reversed order. The first experiment used a speeded lexical decision task with reaction time registration, and the second a delayed lexical decision task with EEG registration. There were no significant group differences in accuracy in the licit word order condition, suggesting that the grammatical representation had been fully acquired by the non-native speakers. However, the Spanish speakers made slightly more errors with the reversed order and had longer response times, suggesting an L1 interference effect (as the reverse order matches the licit word order in Spanish). The EEG data, analyzed with generalized additive mixed models, further supported this hypothesis. The EEG waveform of the non-native speakers was characterized by a slightly later onset N400 in the violation condition (reversed constituent order). Compound frequency predicted the amplitude of the EEG signal for the licit word order for native speakers, but for the reversed constituent order for Spanish speakers\textemdash the licit order in their L1\textemdash supporting the hypothesis that Spanish speakers are affected by interferences from their L1. The pattern of results for the German speakers in the violation condition suggested a strong conflict arising due to licit constituents being presented in an order that conflicts with the expected order in both their L1 and L2.},

Unlike the anomalous words, which evoked a robust N400 effect (on the CW in experiments 1 and 2 as well as on the sentence-final word in experiment 2), CWs in the metaphorical, relative to the literal, sentences only evoked an early, localized N400 effect that was over by 400ms after CW onset, suggesting that, by this time, their metaphorical meaning had been accessed. CWs in the metaphorical sentences also evoked a significantly larger LPC (Late Positive Component) than in the literal sentences. We suggest that this LPC reflected additional analysis that resolved a conflict between the implausibility of the literal sentence interpretation and the match between the metaphorical meaning of the CW, the context and stored information within semantic memory, resulting from early access to both literal and figurative meanings of the CWs.},

This study was aimed to investigate the consequences of the presence or absence of these alternations for the fine structure of lexical representations. Previous research has shown that certain vowel oppositions are processed in an asymmetric way, as studied by means of brain electric activity (e.g. Eulitz \& Lahiri, 2004). Here, we contrasted base form and diminutive stems of German nouns in a Mismatch Negativity (MMN) study. We compared the alternating noun Stock with non-alternating Stoff and obtained a consistently stronger MMN if Stoff was preceded by a fronted stem. This was an initial stem fragment in Experiment 1 and its diminutive form in Experiment 2. The results of our experiments indicate asymmetries in processing at the phonetics/morpho-phonology interface and are discussed on the background of several models of lexical representation and morphological processing. We conjecture that our findings are best explained by differences in abstract phonological representations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

Diving was forbidden from the bridge because the river had rocks in it. or 2. The guests played bridge because the river had rocks in it.). Processing of the targets (e.g., "river") was expected to be primarily influenced by the preceding overall sentence context (congruent in 1; incongruent in 2) in healthy participants, but to be inappropriately affected by the dominant meaning of homographs (e.g., the "structure" meaning of "bridge") in sentences like 2 in schizophrenic patients. The N400 ERP component that is known to be sensitive to contextual effects during language processing confirmed these predictions. This showed that language abnormalities in schizophrenia may be related to deficient processing of context- irrelevant semantic representations of words from the discourse.

The present study tested a fundamental claim about the nature of individual differences in reasoning and the processing demands of both systems. Participants varying in working memory capacity performed a reasoning task while their executive resources were burdened with a secondary task. Results were consistent with the dual-process claim: The executive burden hampered correct reasoning when the believability of a conclusion conflicted with its logical validity, but not when beliefs cued the correct response. However, although participants with high working memory spans performed better than those with lower spans in cases of a conflict, all reasoners showed similar effects of load. The findings support the idea that there are two reasoning systems with differential processing demands, but constitute evidence against qualitative individual differences in the human reasoning machinery.},

The author begins with an illustration of the nature of the problem of other minds in a concrete context, to show how the "reading" of another person's beliefs involves representations of a special kind. The chapter then discusses a circumscribed variety of linguistic determinism. This requires an elaboration of an account of the process by which children acquire complement-taking verbs, to clarify how syntax and semantics are intertwined in this area, and why desire and belief verbs develop along radically different trajectories. The author then responds to three different challenges that have been made to the linguistic determinism theory that the author proposes. At the end, a speculative theory is provided of the linguistic structures involved, using a notion of Point of View domains. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (chapter)},

It seems probable that the conceptual developments of early Theory of Mind form an essential basis for helping to fix at least word reference. In development from 2 to 4 years, no basis exists in research for conclusions about the direction of influence between language and Theory of Mind. At the stage of false belief reasoning, after age 4, the role of the mastery of syntactic complementation is highlighted as a representational tool, that is, language development assists reasoning. The paper presents a brief summary of Theory of Mind, ranging from its earliest beginnings in infancy to the appreciation around age 4 years that others might hold false beliefs and act according to them. For each development, the parallel language developments are described, and questions are raised about the interface between the two. In particular, research that might determine the direction of influence from one to the other is discussed. More work is called for, especially with nonverbal tasks, good experimental linguistic work and other special populations, that might allow a more precise delineation of how language and Theory of Mind interrelate at the interface.},

This 4-year longitudinal study (Grades 2\textendash 5) compared these two factors in three aspects of reading development: pseudoword reading, reading comprehension, and single word reading. Morphological awareness contributed significantly to pseudoword reading and reading comprehension, after controlling prior measures of reading ability, verbal and nonverbal intelligence, and phonological awareness. This contribution was comparable to that of phonological awareness and remained 3 years after morphological awareness was assessed. In contrast, morphological awareness rarely contributed significantly to single word reading. We argue that these results provide evidence that morphological awareness has a wide-ranging role in reading development, one that extends beyond phonological awareness.},

Much research to-date focuses on efficient, scalable, and robust workflow execution, especially in distributed environments. However, many challenges remain in the area of data management related to workflow creation, execution, and result management. In this paper we examine some of these issues in the context of the entire workflow lifecycle.},

  abstract = {Examined event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited in response to semantic processing of non-verbal stories. ERPs were recorded from 29 scalp electrodes on 16 subjects (Ss; 11 females; aged 18-21 yrs) while they viewed series of complex gray-scale pictures, each of which relayed a simple story. The final picture of each story was either congruous or incongruous with the preceding context. Ss made delayed meaningfulness judgments for each story. Averaged ERPs time-locked to the onset of the final picture were more negative for incongruous than congruous pictures. Two distinct components were sensitive to congruency. The 1st component peaked at 325 ms (N300) and was distributed over central and frontal sites. The 2nd component peaked at 500 ms and also had a centro-frontal maximum but was more widespread than the earlier component (anterior N400). The distinct scalp topographies of these 2 negativities provide strong evidence that the N300 and N400 are separate and distinguishable components. The presence of the N300 in this exclusively pictorial task suggests that the N300 is specific to the semantic processing of non-verbal stimuli and is not due to linguistic mediation. N400 can be modulated by discourse-level coherence manipulations with pictures. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2003 APA, all rights reserved).},

Two questions were addressed. First, is the ERP signal sensitive to the morphological productivity of words? Second, does nontarget language activation in L2 processing spread beyond the item itself, to the morphological family of the activated nontarget word? The two behavioural experiments both showed a facilitatory effect of Dutch Family Size, indicating that the morphological family in the L1 is activated regardless of language context. In the two ERP experiments, Family Size effects were found to modulate the N400 component. Less negative waveforms were observed for words with a high L1 Family Size compared to words with a low L1 Family Size in the N400 time window, in both the L1 and L2 task. In addition, these Family Size effects persisted in later time windows. The data are discussed in light of the Morphological Family Resonance Model (MFRM) model of morphological processing and the BIA + model.},

The neural code for written words must be abstract, because we can recognize words regardless of their location, font and size. Yet it must also be exquisitely sensitive to letter identity and letter order. Most existing coding schemes are insufficiently invariant or incompatible with the constraints of the visual system. We propose a tentative neuronal model according to which part of the occipito-temporal `what' pathway is tuned to writing and forms a hierarchy of local combination detectors sensitive to increasingly larger fragments of words. Our proposal can explain why the detection of `open bigrams' (ordered pairs of letters) constitutes an important stage in visual word recognition.},

In the striate cortex, the anatomical substrate for retinotopic organization is suprisingly well ordered, and there seems to be a systematic relationship between ocular dominance strips and cortical magnification. The 2-deoxyglucose maps in this area appear to be largely uninfluenced by known differences in long-term metabolic activity. This method should prove useful in analyzing retinotopic organization in various visual areas of the brain and in different species.}

  abstract = {Many computational models of visual word recognition and reading postulate a central role for phonology. None, however, has successfully simulated one key phenomenon associated with fast-acting phonological influences during word recognition: masked phonological priming (e.g., bloo primes BLUE better than blai primes BLUE). The tricky issue for computational models is not only to simulate such masked phonological priming effects, but at the same time to correctly read aloud irregular words. This double challenge constitutes a new benchmark phenomenon: the fast-phonology test. It has been previously shown that the dual route model of reading aloud (DRC) does not pass the fast-phonology test, unless it is assumed that lexical decisions are always made on the basis of lexical phonological activation. Here we show that the Bimodal Interactive Activation Model (BIAM), an extension of the interactive activation model, can pass the fast-phonology test, while maintaining the ability to discriminate between words and nonwords on the basis of orthographic activation alone. The BIAM achieves this by virtue of implementing a fast parallel mapping of letters onto input phonemes rather than output phonemes as in DRC. It is argued that the BIAM provides an improved architecture for a general model of visual word recognition and reading.

EEG was collected from participants who viewed items varying in number and frequency of both orthographic neighbors and lexical associates. Regression analysis of single item ERPs replicated past findings, showing that N400 amplitudes are greater for items with more neighbors, and further revealed that N400 amplitudes increase for items with more lexical associates and with higher frequency neighbors or associates. Together, the data suggest that in the N400 time window semantic features of items broadly related to inputs are active, consistent with models in which semantic access takes place in parallel with stimulus recognition.},

Some researchers argue that color categories are linguistically constructed, while others claim they have a pre-linguistic, and possibly even innate, basis. Although there is some evidence that 4\textendash 6-month-old infants respond categorically to color, these empirical results have been challenged in recent years. First, it has been claimed that previous demonstrations of color categories in infants may reflect color preferences instead. Second, and more seriously, other labs have reported failing to replicate the basic findings at all. In the current study we used eye-tracking to test 8-month-old infants' categorical perception of a previously attested color boundary (green\textendash blue) and an additional color boundary (blue\textendash purple). Our results show that infants are faster and more accurate at fixating targets when they come from a different color category than when from the same category (even though the chromatic separation sizes were equated). This is the case for both blue\textendash green and blue\textendash purple. Our findings provide independent evidence for the existence of color categories in pre-linguistic infants, and suggest that categorical perception of color can occur without color language.},

Three experiments with 143 college students examined initial fixation position effects for Hebrew readers. In English, the preferred viewing location (where readers' eyes initially land in a word) is to the left of the centre of words, and words presented in isolation are identified more easily when the initial fixation point is near the optimal viewing location (close to the centre of the word). In Experiment 1, the authors found that the preferred viewing location for Hebrew readers was to the right of the centre of words and that it was not modulated by inflectional morphological constraints. However, the results from the word identification task in Experiments 2 and 3 indicated that derivational morphological constraints do modulate the optimal viewing location.

Previous research within the nominal system had showed facilitatory effects from masked primes that shared the same root as the target word, but not when the primes shared the word pattern (R. Frost, K. I. Forster, \& A. Deutsch, 1997). In contrast to these findings, facilitatory effects were obtained for both roots and word patterns in the verbal system. In addition, verbal pattern facilitation was obtained even when the primes were pseudoverbs consisting of illegal combinations of roots and verbal patterns. Significant priming was also found when the primes and the targets contained the same root. The results are discussed with reference to the factors that may determine the lexical status of morphological units in lexical organization. A model of morphological processing of Hebrew words is proposed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Three groups of Ss ( n = 36; aged 18-23 yrs) performed a sentence verification task in which the final word of each sentence was concrete or abstract. For each group the truthfulness judgment required either image generation, a semantic decision, or evaluation of surface characteristics. Results indicate that concrete and abstract words produced similar RTs and ERPs in the surface task, suggesting that postlexical semantic processing is necessary to elicit concreteness effects. In both the semantic and imagery tasks, RTs were shorter for concrete than for abstract words. This difference was greatest in the imagery task. Also, in both of these tasks concrete words elicited more negative ERPs than abstract words between 300 and 550 msec, an effect that was widespread across the scalp. ERPs were also more negative for concrete than abstract words between 550 and 800 msec. This effect was more frontally distributed and was most evident in the imagery task.

We predicted that letter transpositions would disrupt morpho-orthographic processing more than morpho-semantic processing.

Similarly, Experiment 2 showed that although complex nonword primes (bankity-bank) generate significant priming effects relative to unrelated primes (farmity-bank), the same primes with letter transpositions (banikty-bank) do not prime relative to transposed unrelated primes (farimty-bank).},

This hypothesis has been well supported, but some recent data are inconsistent with its predictions. It is becoming increasingly clear that multiple selective agents, and non-selective constraints, must have acted to shape cognitive abilities in humans and other animals. The task now is to develop a larger theoretical framework that takes into account both inter-specific differences and similarities in cognition. This new framework should facilitate consideration of how selection pressures that are associated with sociality interact with those that are imposed by non-social forms of environmental complexity, and how both types of functional demands interact with phylogenetic and developmental constraints.

We quantitatively show that there indeed exists an explicit gradient for feature complexity in the ventral pathway of the human brain. This was achieved by mapping thousands of stimulus features of increasing complexity across the cortical sheet using a deep neural network. Our approach also revealed a fine-grained functional specialization of downstream areas of the ventral stream. Furthermore, it allowed decoding of representations from human brain activity at an unsurpassed degree of accuracy, confirming the quality of the developed approach. Stimulus features that successfully explained neural responses indicate that population receptive fields were explicitly tuned for object categorization. This provides strong support for the hypothesis that object categorization is a guiding principle in the functional organization of the primate ventral stream.},

  abstract = {Deep artificial neural networks have become the go-to method for many machine learning tasks. In the field of computer vision, deep convolutional neural networks achieve state-of-the-art performance for tasks such as classification, object detection or instance segmentation. As deep neural networks become more and more complex, their inner workings become more and more opaque, rendering them a "black box" whose decision making process is no longer comprehensible. In recent years, various methods have been presented that attempt to peek inside the black box and to visualize the inner workings of deep neural networks, with a focus on deep convolutional neural networks for computer vision. These methods can serve as a toolbox to facilitate the design and inspection of neural networks for computer vision and the interpretation of the decision making process of the network. Here, we present the new tool Interactive Feature Localization in Deep neural networks (IFeaLiD) which provides a novel visualization approach to convolutional neural network layers. The tool interprets neural network layers as multivariate feature maps and visualizes the similarity between the feature vectors of individual pixels of an input image in a heat map display. The similarity display can reveal how the input image is perceived by different layers of the network and how the perception of one particular image region compares to the perception of the remaining image. IFeaLiD runs interactively in a web browser and can process even high resolution feature maps in real time by using GPU acceleration with WebGL 2. We present examples from four computer vision datasets with feature maps from different layers of a pre-trained ResNet101. IFeaLiD is open source and available online at https://ifealid.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de.},

It is hypothesized that frequently encountered linguistic expressions are represented in the lexicon. In the basic case, they are represented as access nodes, if they may stand alone, and as MI nodes, if their constituents are already represented by access nodes. Unlike the original MI model, no further stipulation is needed concerning the existence or inhibition properties of MI nodes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2002 APA, all rights reserved).},

Experiment 1 showed that in a Dutch lexical decision task, latencies to root targets were facilitated when visually presented primes were transparent derivations of the target, regardless of whether targets were presented visually or auditorily. Pseudoderivations only provided weak evidence for priming and only when targets were presented visually. In Experiment 2 we tested transparent and opaque priming more thoroughly in a French lexical decision task by using the incremental priming technique in combination with a psychophysical approach. The results showed that opaque as well as transparent derivations facilitated the visual and auditory processing of their (pseudo-) root. However, transparent priming occurred earlier than opaque priming in the visual modality. Moreover, when facilitation from opaque derivations appeared in the visual modality, transparent derivations produced a larger facilitation effect. We argue that our findings illustrate the existence of two distinct processing systems underlying early morphological processing: a morpho-orthographic system and a morpho-semantic system.

First, the model simulates lexical decision results obtained with French/English BLs in 2 masked orthographic priming studies (R. Bijeljac-Babic et al, 1997). Differences in the result patterns for Ss varying in 2nd-language (L2) proficiency are simulated by assuming a reduced frequency range for L2-words. In demonstrating that monolingual Ss likely knew some L2-words, the model displays heuristic value. Second, the BIA model simulates the effects of intra- and interlingual neighborhood density on target WR in blocked and mixed progressive demasking (PDM) with Dutch/English BLs (W. J. B. Van Heuven et al, 1998). The model accounts for a shift in result patterns observed in high-proficiency Ss over parts of the blocked PDM experiment by varying the degree of asymmetric cross-language inhibition from language mode to word level. The model also simulates overall results in the mixed PDM study by manipulation of cross-language inhibition and the frequency range for L2 items.

A similar pattern was found in Experiment 2 with L1 French and L2 English, showing that the effect is due to language dominance and not language per se. Experiment 3 found that proficient French/English bilinguals exhibited a different pattern of language effects showing that these effects are modulated by proficiency. These results lend further support to the hypothesis that word recognition during the early phases of L2 acquisition in late learners of L2 involves a specific set of mechanisms compared with recognition of L1 words.},

Scenarios were constructed to include three potential antecedents. Anaphors were semantically ambiguous in that two of the potential antecedents were exemplars of the anaphor. Final sentences resolved the anaphor with the correct (associatively related/contextually appropriate), incorrect (associatively related/contextually inappropriate), or control antecedent (associatively unrelated/contextually inappropriate). We examined the amplitude of the N400 component, which is thought to reflect the ease of semantic integration, at several points following the anaphor. The smallest N400 was evoked when the text referred back to a correct antecedent following an anaphor; an intermediate N400 was evoked by incorrect antecedents and the largest N400 was evoked by reinstating the control antecedent following an anaphor. Results demonstrated that, following an ambiguous anaphor, readers are able to use both lexico-semantic and discourse-level information to semantically integrate an antecedent into its larger discourse context.

The speech of 10 English-speaking children (aged 1;3 to 5;2) from the CHILDES database (MacWhinney \& Snow, 1985, 1990) were analysed. The rate of noun overregularization is low, mean = 8{$\cdot$}5\%, demonstrating that children prefer correct to overregularized forms. Rates of noun overregularization are not significantly different from their rates of past tense overregularization, and noun plurals, like verb past tenses, follow a U-shaped developmental curve in which correct irregulars precede the first overregularized forms. These facts suggest that plural and past tense overregularizations are caused by similar underlying processes. The results pose challenges to connectionist models, but are consistent with Marcus et al.'s (1992) blocking-and-retrieval-failure model in which regulars are generated by a default rule while irregulars are retrieved from the lexicon.},

Experiential factors influence well-being, and evidence shows that specific forms of training, such as physical exercise and mindfulness meditation, can produce strong and enduring beneficial effects on well-being. These factors also shape the structure and function of our brains throughout the lifespan, with fascinating implications for our well-being. However, understanding how well-being is created (and changed) by our brains has only recently become the focus of neuroscientific investigations. In this chapter, we review recent neuroscientific evidence revealing how the neurocircuitries underlying personality traits (i.e., optimism, negative bias, self-esteem, extraversion, and neuroticism), successful emotional aging, and social relationships (i.e., love and loneliness) contribute to well-being, and how these circuits and systems are altered in chronic stress, anxiety, and depression. Identifying the neural correlates of well-being can illuminate the processes that cause higher levels of wellbeing, which, in turn, can inform promising training interventions that can induce neuroplastic changes and help people live happier, healthier, and more successful lives.},

  abstract = {The scope of linguistic planning, i.e., the amount of linguistic information that speakers prepare in advance for an utterance they are about to produce, is highly variable. Distinguishing between possible sources of this variability provides a way to discriminate between production accounts that assume structurally incremental and lexically incremental sentence planning. Two picture-naming experiments evaluated changes in speakers' planning scope as a function of experience with message structure, sentence structure, and lexical items. On target trials participants produced sentences beginning with two semantically related or unrelated objects in the same complex noun phrase. To manipulate familiarity with sentence structure, target displays were preceded by prime displays that elicited the same or different sentence structures. To manipulate ease of lexical retrieval, target sentences began either with the higher-frequency or lower-frequency member of each semantic pair. The results show that repetition of sentence structure can extend speakers' scope of planning from one to two words in a complex noun phrase, as indexed by the presence of semantic interference in structurally primed sentences beginning with easily retrievable words. Changes in planning scope tied to experience with phrasal structures favor production accounts assuming structural planning in early sentence formulation.},

Results showing that male sexual behavior is impaired following MPOA lesions and enhanced with MPOA stimulation support this conclusion. The neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) facilitates male sexual behavior in all studied species, including rodents and humans. Here, we review data indicating that the MPOA is one site where DA may act to regulate male sexual behavior. DA agonists microinjected into the MPOA facilitate sexual behavior, whereas DA antagonists impair copulation, genital reflexes, and sexual motivation. Moreover, microdialysis experiments showed increased release of DA in the MPOA as a result of precopulatory exposure to an estrous female and during copulation. DA may remove tonic inhibition in the MPOA, thereby enhancing sensorimotor integration, and also coordinate autonomic influences on genital reflexes. In addition to sensory stimulation, other factors influence the release of DA in the MPOA, including testosterone, nitric oxide, and glutamate. Here we summarize and interpret these data.},

One set of cues which learners might use to acquire phrase structure are the dependencies, or predictive relationships, which link elements within phrases. In order to determine whether learners can use this statistical information, adults and children were exposed to artificial languages that either contained or violated the kinds of dependencies that characterize natural languages. Additional experiments contrasted the acquisition of these linguistic systems with the same grammars implemented as non-linguistic input (sequences of nonlinguistic sounds or shapes). Predictive relationships yielded better learning for sequentially presented auditory stimuli, and for simultaneously presented visual stimuli, but no such advantage was found for sequentially presented visual stimuli. Learning outcomes were not affected by the degree to which the input contained linguistic content. These findings suggest that constraints on learning mechanisms that mirror the structure of natural languages are not tailored solely for language learning. Implications for theories of language acquisition and perceptual learning are discussed.},

Homographic priming (Experiment 1), using pairs of words with a superficially similar stem, but without morphological or semantic relation (foco/foca [floodlight/seal]), produced an initial attenuation similar to the morphological pairs, but which rapidly tended to form a delayed N400, due to the impossibility of integration. However, orthographic priming (rasa/rana [flat/frog]) in Experiment 2 does not produce attenuation of the N400 but an effect similar to that of unrelated pairs. Experiment 3 shows that synonyms advance more slowly than morphological pairs to meaning coherence, but finally produce a more positive peak around 600 msec.

  abstract = {This paper proposes a shared, distributed, asymmetrical model for the bilingual mental lexicon. To test the sharing of conceptual relations across translation equivalents, Experiment 1 used the classical priming paradigm with specific methodological innovations, trying to satisfy various constraints that had not been addressed in previous studies. The results suggest shared storage for the conceptual representations of the bilingual's two vocabularies and asymmetrical links between concepts and lexical names in the two languages. Experiment 2 examined the details of meaning separation by eliciting semantic closeness rankings for conceptual relations that are equivalent across language translations and those that are not. The results indicate that bilinguals tend to integrate conceptual differences between translation equivalents, but that they also display a "separatist" tendency to maintain the L1 conceptual system in the representation of L1 words and to adopt the L2 conceptual system in the representation of L2 words.

This article addresses the question of whether the family size of the base word of a complex word likewise affects lexical processing. College students participated in 6 experiments that show that family size plays a role for both inflected and derived words. Posthoc analyses show that the effect of family size is driven by the semantically transparent family members and that this effect is further constrained by semantic selection restrictions of the affix in the target word.

We aimed to identify sleep EEG markers of PTSD that were reproducible across nights and subsamples of our study population.Seventy-eight combat-exposed veteran men with (n = 31) and without (n = 47) PTSD completed two consecutive nights of high-density EEG recordings in a laboratory. We performed spectral-topographical EEG analyses on data from both nights. To assess reproducibility, we used the first 47 consecutive participants (18 with PTSD) for initial discovery and the remaining 31 participants (13 with PTSD) for replication.In the discovery analysis, compared with non-PTSD participants, PTSD participants exhibited (1) reduced delta power (1\textendash 4 Hz) in the centro-parietal regions during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and (2) elevated high-frequency power, most prominent in the gamma band (30\textendash 40 Hz), in the antero-frontal regions during both NREM and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. These findings were consistent across the two study nights, with reproducible trends in the replication analysis. We found no significant group differences in theta power (4\textendash 8 Hz) during REM sleep and sigma power (12\textendash 15 Hz) during N2 sleep.The reduced centro-parietal NREM delta power, indicating reduced sleep depth, and the elevated antero-frontal NREM and REM gamma powers, indicating heightened central arousal, are potential objective sleep markers of PTSD. If independently validated, these putative EEG markers may offer new targets for the development of sleep-specific PTSD diagnostics and interventions.}

He can recognize and comprehend the meaning of written function words, of derivational morphology, and of most inflectional morphology. The authors suggest that his deficit in reading grammatical morphemes is unrelated to his problems in reading nonwords and cannot be explained by their low semanticity and imageability. The patient's speech is ungrammatical but is not devoid of grammatical morphemes and his reading of functional elements improves when these are presented within the context of sentences.

Of importance is whether students can not only read and recognize the structure of morphologically complex words but also determine their meanings. This issue was addressed by investigating the relationship of third and fifth graders' awareness of the structure and meanings of derived words and the relationship of these forms of morphological awareness to word reading and reading comprehension. The results showed that awareness of structure was significantly related to the ability to define morphologically complex words; some aspects were also significantly related to the reading of derived words. The three morphology tasks accounted for significant variance in reading comprehension at both grade levels, but the contribution was stronger for the fifth than the third grade. It may be educationally noteworthy that morphological analysis contributed significantly to reading comprehension for the third graders because they are presumably just beginning to learn to read and understand morphologically complex words.},

In Experiment 2, the primes included the suffix inserted in a nonsense symbol string (e.g., \%\%\%\% er -WALK ER ). In Experiment 3, the primes were formed by a real word that shared the suffix with the target (e.g., bak er -WALK ER ).

However, the existence or detectability of an anticipatory task-set reconfiguration process remains controversial, in part because several neuroimaging studies have not detected extra brain activity during preparation for a task switch relative to a task repeat. In contrast, electrophysiological studies have identified potential correlates of preparation for a task switch, but their interpretation is hindered by the scarcity of evidence on their relationship to performance. We aimed to: (i) identify the brain potential(s) reflecting effective preparation for a task-switch in a task-cuing paradigm that shows clear behavioural evidence for advance preparation, and (ii) characterize this activity by means of temporal segmentation and source analysis. Our results show that when advance preparation was effective (as indicated by fast responses), a protracted switch-related component, manifesting itself as widespread posterior positivity and concurrent right anterior negativity, preceded stimulus onset for ,\`a\textordmasculine 300 ms, with sources primarily in the left lateral frontal, right inferior frontal and temporal cortices. When advance preparation was ineffective (as implied by slow responses), or made impossible by a short cue-stimulus interval (CSI), a similar component, with lateral prefrontal generators, peaked ,\`a\textordmasculine 300 ms poststimulus. The protracted prestimulus component (which we show to be distinct from P3 or contingent negative variation, CNV) also correlated over subjects with a behavioural measure of preparation. Furthermore, its differential lateralization for word and picture cues was consistent with a role for verbal self-instruction in preparatory task-set reconfiguration.

In Experiment 2, compound words were preceded by other compound words that shared one of their constituents, but in a different lexeme position (e.g., the first constituent of the compound that acted as a prime was the second constituent of the compound that acted as a target). Results again showed a constituent priming effect (i.e., location in the string is not necessary for priming to occur). In Experiment 3, we demonstrated that these priming effects were not due to mere form overlap: pairs of noncompound words that shared either the beginning or the ending chunk did not produce a priming effect. Taken together, the present results converge with previous data on orthographic/morphological priming and provide evidence favouring early morphological decomposition.},

  abstract = {In the present issue, we bring together papers that help address the role of morphology in reading by providing a cross-language perspective. Our review of previous studies shows that a variety of models has been used to explain the use of morphological units in reading processes. Of course, it is not possible to reconcile the theoretical frameworks into one model. Much more research on the neurocognitive modeling of morphological decomposition processes is needed to arrive at final answers. For now, it can be claimed that morphological decomposition in reading complex words reflects a learned sensitivity to the systematic relationships among the surface forms of words and their meanings. Morphology is thus considered to be a universal response of the reader to the quasi regular characteristics in a given language. However, given that languages substantially differ in morphological richness, language-specific effects on morphological processing can also be predicted. To address the role of cross-linguistic differences, this issue compiles a set of nine research-based papers on morphological processing in word reading and spelling in two Germanic languages (English, Dutch), two Romance languages (French, Italian), Hebrew, and Finnish. Moreover, the role of morphology in word reading is also highlighted in Chinese-English, Spanish-English bilinguals, and in bilingual deaf readers of Dutch.

The processing of Finnish inflected vs. monomorphemic words and pseudowords was examined during a lexical decision task, using behavioral responses and event-related potentials. The stimuli were presented in two modalities, visually and auditorily, to two groups of participants. Half of the words and pseudowords carried a case-inflection. At the behavioral level, the inflected words elicited a processing cost with longer decision latencies and higher error rates. At the neural level, pseudowords elicited an N400 effect, which was more pronounced in the visual modality. Inflected words elicited an N400 effect in both modalities, which, however, differed in topography and latency. The N400 effect for inflected words most probably reflects access and possible integration of the stem and suffix. The results suggest that the inflectional processing cost stems from the later, lexical-semantic stage of processing in both modalities. The ERP responses to inflected pseudowords did not differ from the ERP responses to monomorphemic pseudowords in either modality, suggesting that combinatorial case-inflection processing requires a real word stem in order to proceed.

The present work investigates this issue via an orthographic similarity manipulation. Three masked priming lexical decision experiments were conducted to examine the transposed-letter similarity effect (e.g., jugde facilitates JUDGE more than the control jupbe) in polymorphemic and monomorphemic words. If morphological decomposition occurs at early stages of visual word recognition, we would expect an interaction with transposed-letter effects. Experiment 1 was carried out in Basque, which is an agglutinative language. The nonword primes were created by transposing two letters that either crossed the morphological boundaries of suffixes or did not. Results showed a transposed-letter effect for non-affixed words, whereas there were no signs of a transposed-letter effect across morpheme boundaries for affixed words. In Experiment 2, this issue was revisited in a non-agglutinative language (Spanish), with prefixed and suffixed word pairs. Again, results showed a significant transposed-letter effect for non-affixed words, whereas there were no signs of a transposed-letter effect across morpheme boundaries for affixed words (both prefixed words and suffixed words). Experiment 3 replicated the previous findings, and also revealed that, for polymorphemic words, transposed-letter priming effects occurred for within-morpheme transpositions. Taken together, these findings support the view that morphological decomposition operates at an early stage of visual word recognition.},

To demonstrate this and provide evidence about optimal filter settings, we recorded ERPs in a typical language processing paradigm involving syntactic and semantic violations. Unfiltered results showed standard N400 and P600 effects in the semantic and syntactic violation conditions, respectively. However, high-pass filters with cutoffs at 0.3 Hz and above produced artifactual effects of opposite polarity before the true effect. That is, excessive high-pass filtering introduced a significant N400 effect preceding the P600 in the syntactic condition, and a significant P2 effect preceding the N400 in the semantic condition. Thus, inappropriate use of high-pass filters can lead to false conclusions about which components are influenced by a given manipulation. The present results also lead to practical recommendations for high-pass filter settings that maximize statistical power while minimizing filtering artifacts.},

  abstract = {(from the chapter) The issues discussed in this chapter center on the relations between children's talk and conversations and the development of their mind-reading abilities. Two particular interests frame the way these connections are examined herein. The first concerns the development of close relationships. The discoveries children make about others' inner states are central to the development of their relationships. The authors argue that a key entry into the community of minds (Nelson, this volume, chapter 2) may be through the experience of communication within close dyadic relationships--that communicative experiences within close, familiar relationships play an especially important role in the development of understanding of emotion and mind. The authors are concerned both with the concurrent relations among language, social understanding, and relationships and with the antecedent and consequent associations among these domains over time. Note that the focus here is upon the implications for theory of mind of the communicational aspects of language (the argument being that children become aware of people's mental states in part through conversations and stories), rather than the representational aspect of language (the argument that the development of prepositional language allows children to think about what is in people's minds when they [mis]represent the world). The second interest that frames the chapter is a concern with individual differences in each of these domains. Within the framework of this interest in individual differences, then, the authors consider here two issues. The first, the main issue with which this chapter is concerned, centers on the links between theory of mind and communication. The second issue, which is discussed more briefly, concerns the developmental patterns and processes implicated beyond the early preschool years. A focus on individual differences in communication and understanding of other minds highlights some key lessons and questions about the social processes implicated in children's discovery of the mind. Central to these lessons is the notion that children's language should be observed not solely as a cognitive skill or as an individual characteristic but also as a reflection of their participation in the social processes implicated in the development of understanding of mind. In what follows the authors raise a series of questions for discussion and highlight some cautions about inferences to be made from the evidence available on each of these issues.

Social studies was included on the assumption that comprehension instruction is required by the difficulty of social studies textbooks. Grades 3 through 6 were selected for the observations on the assumption that more comprehension instruction exists there than in grades 1 and 2. Major findings included the fact that almost no comprehension instruction was found. The attention that did go to comprehension focused on assessment, which was carried on through teacher questions. Instruction other than that for comprehension was also rare. It could not be concluded, therefore, that teachers neglect comprehension because they are busy teaching phonics, structural analysis, or word meanings. What they do attend to are written assignments. As a result, time spent on giving, completing, and checking assignments consumed a large part of the observed periods. Sizeable amounts of time also went to activities categorized as "Transition" and "Non-instruction." Other findings indicated that none of the observed teachers view social studies as a time to help with reading comprehension. Rather, they see their responsibility as covering content and having children master facts./// [French] Examine d'apr\`es l'observation en classes de lecture et d'instruction civique si les \'ecoles primaires fournissent une instruction qui d\'eveloppe la compr\'ehension en lecture des \'el\`eves.

When does human vision interpolate a contour between a given pair of luminance-defined edges? Two different answers have been proposed: relatability and minimizing inflections. We state and prove a proposition that links these two proposals by showing that, under appropriate conditions, relatability is mathematically equivalent to the existence of a smooth curve with no inflection points that interpolates between the two edges. The proposition thus provides a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for two edges to be relatable. On the basis of these conditions, we suggest a way to extend the definition of relatability (1) to include the role of genericity, and (2) to extend the current all-or-none character of relatability to a graded measure that can track the gradedness in psychophysical data.},

In the first experiment, Dutch-English bilinguals performing a 2nd language (L2) lexical decision task were faster to recognize identical and nonidentical cognate words (e.g., banaan-banana) presented in isolation than control words. A second experiment replicated this effect when the same set of cognates was presented as the final words of low-constraint sentences. In a third experiment that used eyetracking, the authors showed that early target reading time measures also yield cognate facilitation but only for identical cognates. These results suggest that a sentence context may influence, but does not nullify, cross-lingual lexical interactions during early visual word recognition by bilinguals.},

The spatial coding model described here adopts a different approach to letter position coding and lexical matching based on context-independent letter representations. In this model, letter position is coded dynamically, with a scheme called spatial coding. Lexical matching is achieved via a method called superposition matching, in which input codes and learned codes are matched on the basis of the relative positions of their common letters. Simulations of the model illustrate its ability to explain a broad range of results from the masked form priming literature, as well as to capture benchmark findings from the unprimed lexical decision task.},

We investigated perceptual reorganization for tones by testing 6- and 9-month-old infants from tone (Chinese) and nontone (English) language environments for speech (lexical tone) and nonspeech (violin sound) tone discrimination in both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Overall, Chinese infants performed equally well at 6 and 9 months for both speech and nonspeech tone discrimination. Conversely, English infants' discrimination of lexical tone declined between 6 and 9 months of age, whereas their nonspeech tone discrimination remained constant. These results indicate that the reorganization of tone perception is a function of the native language environment, and that this reorganization is linguistically based.

Basal autonomic levels did not statistically differentiate groups. In all groups, HR levels increased with task complexity, but more so on reward than on nonreward trials. In the intertrial interval, HR decelerated consistently when Ss were anticipating stimuli associated with reward; but when reward was uncertain, HR accelerated slightly or stayed the same. Control Ss exhibited anticipatory HR deceleration more consistently than did clinical Ss, especially the solely hyperactive ones. Skin conductance levels first decreased, then rose as task complexity increased, but the groups did not differ on this measure. A conditioning model is outlined to explain directional changes in HR.

  abstract = {The metallic impregnation invented by Camillo Golgi in 1873 has allowed the visualization of individual neurons in their entirety, leading to a breakthrough in the knowledge on the structure of the nervous system. Professor of Histology and of General Pathology, Golgi worked for decades at the University of Pavia, leading a very active laboratory. Unfortunately, most of Golgi's histological preparations are lost. The present contribution provides an account of the original slides on the nervous system from Golgi's laboratory available nowadays at the Golgi Museum and Historical Museum of the University of Pavia. Knowledge on the organization of the nervous tissue at the time of Golgi's observations is recalled. Notes on the equipment of Golgi's laboratory and the methodology Golgi used for his preparations are presented. Images of neurons from his slides (mostly from hippocampus, neocortex and cerebellum) are here shown for the first time together with some of Golgi's drawings. The sections are stained with the Golgi impregnation and Cajal stain. Golgi-impregnated sections are very thick (some more than 150 {$\mu$}m) and require continuous focusing during the microscopic observation. Heterogeneity of neuronal size and shape, free endings of distal dendritic arborizations, axonal branching stand out at the microscopic observation of Golgi-impregnated sections and in Golgi's drawings, and were novel findings at his time. Golgi also pointed out that the axon only originates from cell bodies, representing a constant and distinctive feature of nerve cells which distinguishes them from glia, and subserving transmission at a distance. Dendritic spines can be seen in some cortical neurons, although Golgi, possibly worried about artifacts, did not identify them. The puzzling intricacy of fully impregnated nervous tissue components offered to the first microscopic observations still elicit nowadays the emotion Golgi must have felt looking at his slides.},

EEGs were recorded at central and parietal sites, 1-sec pre- and poststimulus onset, on 3 types of trials. The resulting wave forms, averaged over trials, were converted to the frequency domain and factored by principal components. Four components accounting for 87\% of the variance were varimax-rotated. ANOVA of the component scores revealed that Component 1 differentiated the four groups. This component had highest loadings in frequencies from 16 to 20 Hz and secondary loading in frequencies from 7 to 10 Hz.

Using brain potential recordings, we investigated task-switching with ,\"A\`ounivalent,\"A\^o stimuli affording responses in only one of the tasks, and compared the outcomes to those recently obtained with bivalent stimuli (Lavric et al. [2008]: Eur J Neurosci 1-14), in order to examine two phenomena. First, when only univalent stimuli are presented, the processing of task cues becomes optional. Our results showed that in these circumstances linguistic (but not pictorial) cues were still effective in eliciting at least some degree of preparation for a taskswitch, as evidenced by the reduction in the error cost of switching at the longer preparation interval and by a posterior switch-induced ERP positivity at about 450,\"A\`i800 ms in the cue-stimulus interval. Second, single affordance stimuli not only reduced behavioural switch costs relative to bivalent stimuli; they also produced a smaller post-stimulus switch-induced negativity, consistent with the latter being a marker of conflict between task-sets. However, using stimuli not associated with responses in the alternative task did not completely eliminate the negativity. We speculate that the residue reflects other sources of conflict: attention to the irrelevant perceptual dimension and/or persistence of task goals.

The objective of this study is to integrate information from instruments that measure depression from different perspectives\textendash a self-report symptomatic scale, a clinician-rated scale, and a clinician-rated scale of depressive signs\textendash in order to investigate the multiple dimensions underlying the depressive construct. Methods: A sample of 399 patients from a mood disorders outpatient unit was investigated with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), and the Core Assessment of Psychomotor Change (CORE). Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) were used to investigate underlying dimensions of depression, including item level analysis with factor loadings and item thresholds. Results: A solution of six depression dimensions has shown good-fit to the data, with no cross-loading items, and good interpretability. Item-level analysis revealed that the multidimensional depressive construct might be organized into a continuum of severity in the following ascending order: sexual, cognitive, insomnia, appetite, non-interactiveness/motor retardation, and agitation. Conclusion: An integration of both signs and symptoms, as well as the perspectives of clinicians and patients, might be a good clinical and research alternative for the investigation of (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

Native German speakers with intermediate or advanced knowledge of English (N~=~48) performed an all-L2 (English) experiment where sentences such as ``The woman gave her friend an expensive gift'' (control prime: item) were presented, followed by targets (i.e., boss) for lexical decision. To test the role of global task effects during sentence processing, we presented half the participants (N~=~24) with a 20-min silent film narrated in German and half (N~=~24) with the film in English before the experiment. To address the development of task effects over time, we analyzed the first and second blocks of the experiment. The results showed a significant interaction between semantic priming, movie version, and block in both the RTs and ERPs: there was significant semantic priming in the RTs and modulations in the N200 and N400 components only for participants who viewed the German movie, and only during the first block. Results suggest that in an all-L2 sentence task with L2 pre-task priming (English film), decision thresholds are raised high enough to eliminate measurable influence of the L1 on the L2. Despite identical material, participants who viewed the German film had to adjust, or zoom in, to the all-L2 task. Implications of this zooming in process in are discussed in terms of the recent Bilingual Interactive Activation (BIA+) model of bilingual word recognition [T. Dijkstra, W.J.B.

Even so, differences in perceptual processing may substantially affect learning across modalities. In three experiments, statistically equivalent auditory and visual familiarizations were presented under different timing conditions that either facilitated or disrupted temporal processing (fast or slow presentation rates). We find an interaction of rate and modality of presentation: At fast rates, auditory ISL was superior to visual. However, at slow presentation rates, the opposite pattern of results was found: Visual ISL was superior to auditory. Thus, we find that changes to presentation rate differentially affect ISL across sensory modalities. Additional experiments confirmed that this modality-specific effect was not due to cross-modal interference or attentional manipulations. These findings suggest that ISL is rooted in modality-specific, perceptually based processes.},

  abstract = {We discuss theoretical approaches to blocking effects, with particular emphasis on cases in which words appear to block phrases (and perhaps vice versa). These approaches share at least one intuition: that syntactic and semantic features create possible ``cells'' or slots in which particular items can appear, and that blocking occurs when one such cell is occupied by one form as opposed to another. Accounts of blocking differ along two primary dimensions: the size of the objects that compete with one another (morphemes, words, phrases, sentences); and whether or not ungrammatical forms are taken into consideration in determining the correct output (relatedly, whether otherwise well-formed objects are marked ungrammatical by competition). We argue that blocking in the sense of competition for the expression of syntactic or semantic features is limited to insertion of the phonological exponents of such features (the Vocabulary items of Distributed Morphology) at terminal nodes from the syntax. There is thus no blocking at the word level or above, and no competition between grammatical and ungrammatical structures. The architectural significance of these points is emphasized throughout the discussion.},

  abstract = {Recent neurolinguistic studies present somewhat conflicting evidence concerning the role of the inferior temporal cortex (IT) in visual word recognition within the first 200 ms after presentation. On the one hand, fMRI studies of the Visual Word Form Area (VWFA) suggest that the IT might recover representations of the orthographic form of words. On the other hand, influential MEG studies of responses from the occipito-temporal regions around 150 ms post-stimulus onset indicate recognition of letters as opposed to symbols but not a sensitivity to statistical properties of letter strings associated with word form representations. Recent MEG experiments support the position that the IT does represent the visual word forms of morphemes and performs morphological decomposition modulated by the statistical relations between morphemes by 170 ms post presentation (at the M170 response). Responses to heteronyms show that the M170 does not make contact with the mental lexicon where word forms are connected to meanings. We report here an MEG study of pseudo-affixed words like brother, which masked priming studies have shown are decomposed in recognition. If the M170 response from IT does index obligatory morphological decomposition based on visual word forms but not lexical entries, we should find that the statistical relation between pseudo-stem and pseudo-suffix modulates the M170 for pseudo-affixed words, as for truly affixed words. The results of this experiment confirm this prediction. In addition, surface form frequency for these words also modulates the M170, providing some support for dual route recognition for words for which decomposition is a garden path.

  abstract = {Abstract Three auditory lexical decision experiments were conducted which investigated how morphological structure is represented in the lexicon. The first experiment showed that morphological relationships can be represented independently of semantic relatedness. A large facilitatory priming effect was found for morphologically related words that were not semantically related (e.g. submit, permit). Significant priming was not found for words that were simply phonologically related (e.g. balloon, saloon). The second and third experiments indicated that suffixes do not have lexical representations that can be primed during lexical access; morpholgical priming was not found between words that shared a suffix (e.g. joking, typing). Formal models which propose separate lexical entries for affixes are not supported. Finally, phonological priming was observed when words shared a final syllable but not when they simply shared final segments. Models of word recognition which include a level of syllabic representation are favoured over those which do not.},

  abstract = {The research described here combines psycholinguistically well-motivated questions about different aspects of human language comprehension with behavioural and neuroimaging studies of normal performance, incorporating both subtractive analysis techniques and functional connectivity methods, and applying these tasks and techniques to the analysis of the functional and neural properties of brain-damaged patients with selective linguistic deficits in the relevant domains. The results of these investigations point to a set of partially dissociable sub-systems supporting three major aspects of spoken language comprehension, involving regular inflectional morphology, sentence-level syntactic analysis and sentence-level semantic interpretation. Differential patterns of fronto-temporal connectivity for these three domains confirm that the core aspects of language processing are carried out in a fronto-temporo-parietal language system which is modulated in different ways as a function of different linguistic processing requirements. No one region or sub-region holds the key to a specific language function; each requires the coordination of activity within a number of different regions. Functional connectivity analysis plays the critical role of indicating the regions which directly participate in a given sub-process, by virtue of their joint time-dependent activity. By revealing these codependencies, connectivity analysis sharpens the pattern of structure\textendash function relations underlying specific aspects of language performance.},

Effects of bimodal bilingualism on behavior and brain organization are reviewed, and an fMRI investigation of the recognition of facial expressions by ASL-English bilinguals is reported. The fMRI results reveal separate effects of sign language and spoken language experience on activation patterns within the superior temporal sulcus. In addition, the strong left-lateralized activation for facial expression recognition previously observed for deaf signers was not observed for hearing signers. We conclude that both sign language experience and deafness can affect the neural organization for recognizing facial expressions, and we argue that bimodal bilinguals provide a unique window into the neurocognitive changes that occur with the acquisition of two languages.},

Results of Exp 1 indicated that Ss exposed to ASL in late childhood were not as sensitive to morphological complexity as native signers, but this result was not replicated in Exp 2. Both experiments showed stronger facilitation with aspect morphology compared to agreement morphology. Repetition priming was not observed for nonsigns. The scope and structure of the morphological rules for ASL aspect and agreement are argued to explain the different patterns of morphological priming.

This paper explores the concept of mental models and a highly related concept, the situation model. Through the situation model, a method for abstracting user knowledge and creating usable models of their mental model is explored.

The critical items for the comprehension task consisted of object/subject garden paths (e.g., While Anna dressed the baby that was small and cute played in the crib), and participants answered a comprehension question (e.g., Did Anna dress the baby?) following each one. Previous studies have shown that garden-path misinterpretations tend to persist into final interpretations. Results showed that both intelligence and processing speed interacted with ambiguity. Individuals with higher intelligence and faster processing were more likely to answer the comprehension questions correctly and, specifically, following ambiguous as opposed to unambiguous sentences. Inhibition produced a marginal effect, but the variance in inhibition was largely shared with intelligence. Conclusions focus on the role of individual differences in cognitive ability and their impact on syntactic ambiguity resolution. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

The concept of shock apparently emerged in the middle of the 18th century (Whyett) as an occurrence observed experimentally after spinal cord transection, and identified as "shock" phenomenon one century later (Hall). The concept was extended (Brown-S\'equard) and it was suggested that brain lesions caused functional rupture in regions distant from the injured one ("action \`a distance"). The term "diaschisis" (von Monakow), proposed as a new modality of shock, had its concept broadened, underpinned by observations of patients, aiming at distinguishing between symptoms of focal brain lesions and transitory effects they produced, attributable to depression of distant parts of the brain connected to the injured area. Presently, diaschisis is related mainly to cerebrovascular lesions and classified according to the connection fibers involved, as proposed by von Monakow. Depression of metabolism and blood flow in regions anatomically separated, but related by connections with the lesion, allows observing diaschisis with neuroimaging.},

First, in order to establish which putative learning phenomena are sufficiently robust to constitute a target for modelling, we ran large-scale elicited production studies with native learners of Finnish (N\,=\,77; 35\textendash 63\,months) and Polish (N\,=\,81; 35\textendash 59\,months), using a novel method that, unlike previous studies, allows for elicitation of all six person/number forms in the paradigm (first, second and third person; singular and plural). We then proceeded to build and test a connectionist model of the acquisition of person/number marking which not only acquires near adult-like mastery of the system (including generalisation to unseen items), but also yields all of the key phenomena observed in the elicited-production studies; specifically, effects of token frequency and phonological neighbourhood density of the target form, and a pattern whereby errors generally reflect the replacement of low frequency targets by higher-frequency forms of the same verb, or forms with the same person/number as the target, but with a suffix from an inappropriate conjugation class. The findings demonstrate that acquisition of even highly complex systems of inflectional morphology can be accounted for by a theoretical model that assumes rote storage and phonological analogy, as opposed to formal symbolic rules.},

Results demonstrate that form-priming effects in Hebrew or Arabic are unreliable, whereas morphological priming effects with minimal letter overlap are robust. Hebrew bilingual subjects, by contrast, showed robust form-priming effects with English material, suggesting that Semitic words are lexically organized by morphological rather than orthographic principles.

  abstract = {After a person has become stuck on a problem, they sometimes achieve a clear and sudden solution through insight \textendash{} the so-called Aha! experience. Because of its distinctive experience, the origins and characteristics of insight have received considerable attention historically in psychological research. However, despite considerable progress in characterizing insight, the underlying mechanisms remain mysterious. We argue that research on insight could be greatly advanced by supplementing traditional insight research, which depends on a few complex problems, with paradigms common in other domains of cognitive science. We describe a large set of mini-insight problems to which multiple methods can be applied, together with subjective reports to identify insight problem-solving. Behavioral priming and neuroimaging methods are providing evidence about what, where, and how neural activity occurs during insight. Such evidence constrains theories of component processes, and will help to demystify insight.},

Results showed that, relative to typical children, the difficulties of children and adolescents with autism were not limited to, or disproportionately severe for, faces. Rather, these participants demonstrated significant difficulties in remembering and discriminating between faces and cars. This lack of face selectivity is inconsistent with prominent theories that attribute face-processing difficulties in autism to fundamental problems with social motivation or social attention. Instead, our results are consistent with a more pervasive perceptual atypicality that may affect autistic processing of non-face stimuli as well as face stimuli.},

The goal of our study was to clarify how focal lesions restricted to the basal ganglia interfere with different aspects of implicit visuo-motor sequence learning. A version of the Serial Reaction Time Task (SRTT) of Nissen and Bullemer using a 12-trial sequence was administered. A total of 20 subjects with focal basal ganglia lesions caused by ischemic or hemorrhagic infarction and 20 matched control subjects participated in this study. The results indicate that subjects with focal basal ganglia lesions showed unimpaired implicit learning of a 12-item motor sequence. Subjects with basal ganglia lesions, however, had more difficulties improving their general proficiency with the reaction-time task independent of sequence-specific learning. We observed a tendency toward smaller regional volumes in the cerebellum and left pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) of subjects with basal ganglia lesions. Smaller cerebellar and pre-SMA volumes were related to lower implicit learning performance in the lesion group. The size of lesions in the basal ganglia was not related to sequence-specific implicit learning but had a significant influence on subjects' general proficiency for execution of the reaction-time task. We propose that implicit learning is achieved by a distributed network of cortical and subcortical structures. The basal ganglia seem to be responsible for adjusting to the general requirements of a task rather than for learning specific associations between stimuli that might be accomplished by premotor frontal areas and the cerebellum instead.},

In a previous study, we claimed to have provided evidence supporting the temporal decay hypothesis (S. Portrat, P. Barrouillet, \& V. Camos, 2008). However, reanalyzing our data, S. Lewandowsky and K. Oberauer (2009) demonstrated that they do not provide compelling evidence for temporal decay and suggested a class of alternative models favoring a representation-based interference account. In this article, we develop from the most recent proposals made by Lewandowsky and Oberauer 2 of the most plausible extensions of these alternative models. We show that neither of these extensions can account for recent findings related to between-domain WM performance and that both lead to predictions that are contradicted by new empirical evidence. Finally, we show that recent studies that have been claimed to rule out the temporal decay hypothesis do not resist close scrutiny. We conclude that the time-based resource-sharing model remains the most parsimonious way to account for forgetting and restoration of memory traces in WM.

The structure of this communication system can be explained as a consequence of the evolution of the human biological capacity for language or the cultural evolution of language itself. We argue, supported by a formal model, that an explanatory account that involves some role for cultural evolution has profound implications for our understanding of the biological evolution of the language faculty: under a number of reasonable scenarios, cultural evolution can shield the language faculty from selection, such that strongly constraining language-specific learning biases are unlikely to evolve. We therefore argue that language is best seen as a consequence of cultural evolution in populations with a weak and/or domain-general language faculty.},

We review the evidence for this claim and argue that neither the neuropsychological nor neuroimaging data are consistent with a cortical region specialized for visual word form representations. Specifically, there are no reported cases of pure alexia who have deficits limited to visual word form processing and damage limited to the left midfusiform. In addition, we present functional imaging data to demonstrate that the so-called VWFA is activated by normal subjects during tasks that do not engage visual word form processing such as naming colors, naming pictures, reading Braille, repeating auditory words, and making manual action responses to pictures of meaningless objects. If the midfusiform region has a single function that underlies all these tasks, then it does not correspond to visual word form processing. On the other hand, if the region participates in several functions as defined by its interactions with other cortical areas, then identifying the neural system sustaining visual word form representations requires identification of the set of regions involved. We conclude that there is no evidence that visual word form representations are subtended by a single patch of neuronal cortex and it is misleading to label the left midfusiform region as the visual word form area.},

Half of the contexts were highly constraining. In both groups, expected words elicited less negativity 300-500 ms (N400) than unexpected ones, and unexpected words elicited smaller N400s when these were categorically related. Whereas younger adults showed the greatest N400 reduction to unexpected but related words in high constraint contexts, older adults showed the opposite tendency. Thus, unlike younger adults, older adults as a group do not seem to be using context predictively. Older adults with higher verbal fluency and larger vocabularies, however, showed the younger response pattern, suggesting resource availability may offset certain age-related changes.

  abstract = {Three experiments investigated whether perception of a spelling-to-sound inconsistent word such as MOOD involves coding of inappropriate phonology caused by knowledge of enemy neighbors (e.g., BLOOD) in non-native speakers. In a new bimodal matching task, Dutch-English bilinguals judged the correspondence between a printed English word and a speech segment that was or was not the printed word's rime. Evidence for coding of inappropriate phonology was obtained with trials in which the speech segment was derived from an English enemy neighbor. In such trials, error rates increased significantly relative to control trials. This effect was also found when speech segments were derived from Dutch enemy neighbors, which suggests inappropriate coding of cross-language phonology. These findings are consistent with a strong phonological theory of word perception (Frost, 1998), in which phonological coding is essentially a language non-selective process.},

  abstract = {(from the chapter) This chapter analyzes genetic and environmental influences on individual differences in language and theory of mind. The chapter begins with some general comments about why the relation between language and theory of mind is likely to be very complex. Two related points concern definitions for theory of mind and developmental shifts in the nature of relations between theory of mind and language. A third point concerns the distinction between the factors that underlie associations between individual differences in theory of mind and language, and those that underpin developmental links between these two domains. Taken together, these points highlight the need for a greater range and sophistication of methodological designs within theory-of-mind research. In response to this gap, in the second part of this chapter the author considers the merits of the twin-study design as a novel methodological perspective from which to investigate individual differences in theory of mind. This section begins with an outline of some of the terms used in behavioral genetic research, and of the rationale for twin studies. Next, findings from the only published theory-of-mind twin study to date and from a more recent and much larger twin study are briefly presented. The chapter ends with a discussion of how the contrasting findings from these two studies may suggest developmental change in the relations between individual differences in theory of mind and language.

Some interpret the (null) finding of equal facilitation after semantically transparent and opaque morphologically related primes in early stages of morphological processing as consistent with this view. Recent literature suggests that morphological facilitation tends to be greater after transparent than after opaque primes, however. To determine whether the degree of semantic transparency influences parsing into a stem and a suffix (morphological decomposition) in the forward masked priming variant of the lexical decision paradigm, we compared patterns of facilitation between semantically transparent (e.g., coolant\textendash cool) and opaque (e.g., rampant\textendash ramp) prime\textendash{} target pairs. Form properties of the stem (frequency, neighborhood size, and prime\textendash target letter overlap), as well as related\textendash unrelated and transparent\textendash opaque affixes, were matched. Morphological facilitation was significantly greater for semantically transparent pairs than for opaque pairs. Ratings of prime\textendash target relatedness predicted the magnitude of facilitation. The results limit the scope of form-then-meaning models of word recognition and demonstrate that semantic similarity can influence even early stages of morphological processing.

Without them, they can't exemplify syntactic patterns, morphological structure, or even the sound patterns of their language. Words, in short, offer the primary linguistic means for conveying meaning. English-speaking adults, for example, make use of a production lexicon of anywhere from 20,000 to 50,000 wordforms; their comprehension lexicon is even larger. Learning words, then, is a major part of learning language, and it is inextricably linked to the acquisition of syntax, of morphology, and of phonology. By age two, children may be able to produce anywhere from 50 to 500 or 600 words. They add steadily to this stock at a rate estimated at around ten words a day, to reach a vocabulary of some 14,000 by age six. From then on, children average at least 3,000 new words a year through age 17. It has also been estimated that, from about age ten on, schoolchildren are exposed to about 10,000 new words a year; so by age 15, they have been exposed to some 85,000 word roots and as many as 100,000 distinct word meanings in school texts alone.},

We manipulated the factor of first language (L1) attrition in an event-related potential (ERP) experiment to disentangle Costa and colleagues\&rsquo; selective processing proposal versus the traditional nonselective processing view of bilingual lexical access. Spanish\&ndash;English bilinguals demonstrated an N400 effect of L1 attrition during implicit L1 processing in a second language (L2) semantic judgment task, indicating the contribution of variable L1 lexical access during L2 processing.

In Hebrew, by contrast, the morphemes of a word can be but are not generally concatenated. Instead, a pattern of vowels is infixed between the consonants of the root morpheme. Consequently, the shared portion of morphologically-related words in Hebrew is not always an orthographic unit. In a series of three experiments using the repetition priming task with visually presented Hebrew materials, primes that were formed from the same base morpheme and were morphologically-related to a target facilitated target recognition. Moreover, morphologically-related prime and target pairs that contained a disruption to the shared orthographic pattern showed the same pattern of facilitation as did nondisrupted pairs. That is, there was no effect over successive prime and target presentations, of disrupting the sequence of letters that constitutes the base morpheme or root. In addition, facilitation was similar across derivational, inflectional and identical primes. The conclusion of the present study is that morphological effects in word recognition are distinct from the effects of shared structure.},

In Exps 2 (n=24) and 3 (n=24), targets were presented in an unfamiliar format or targets for which word/nonword discriminations were difficult. In Exp 4 (n=32), a prediction regarding the trade-off between processing efficiency and discounting the sense of familiarity to correctly classify a nonword target that follows a repetition prime was tested. It was demonstrated that masked priming of nonwords can be reliably produced, indicating that primes operate at a nonlexical level, primarily to facilitate orthographic encoding. The processing fluency created by a masked prime can work against correct classification of nonwords in a lexical decision task, leading either to no effect of priming or to an interference effect when Ss depend heavily on familiarity as a basis for lexical decisions.

Classical methodological considerations pertaining to the statistical analysis of RT data are optimized for analyses of aggregated data, based on subject or item means (c.f., Forster \& Dickinson, 1976). Mixed-effects modeling (see, e.g., Baayen, Davidson, \& Bates, 2008) does not require prior aggregation and allows the researcher the more ambitious goal of predicting individual responses. Mixed-modeling calls for a reconsideration of the classical methodological strategies for analysing rts. In this study, we argue for empirical exibility with respect to the choice of transformation for the RTs. We advocate minimal a-priori data trimming, combined with model criticism. We also show how trial-to-trial, longitudinal dependencies between individual observations can be brought into the statistical model. These strategies are illustrated for a large dataset with a non-trivial random-effects structure.

The identity condition consisted of the target (TURN). The morphological condition included a related form (TURNED). The orthographic condition consisted of morphologically unrelated words (TURNIP). Finally, no similar word was presented in the study phase of the no-prime condition. Morphological relatives included orthographically transparent (TURNED-TURN) and orthographically opaque (RIDDEN-RIDE) forms. The results indicate that performance of child readers on the fragment completion task was sensitive to morphological relationships. Completion rates following opaque, as well as transparent, morphological relatives were significantly greater than those following orthographically similar forms. In sum, the fragment completion task provides a viable tool for examining morphological processing in children and for differentiating morphological effects from effects of similar form.

In Dutch, a linking -s- or -en can appear between the constituents of a nominal compound. The authors present production experiments, with native Dutch-speaking Ss, that show that the choice of linking morphemes in novel compounds is analogically determined by the distribution of linking morphemes in "constituent families". A "constituent family" is the set of existing compounds that share the first (or second) constituent with the novel compound. Results also show that in the case of derived pseudo-words as first constituents, it is the family of the suffix that influences the choice of the following linking morpheme. Simulation studies show that choices made by Ss are predicted with a high degree of accuracy using a machine-learning algorithm for analogy. These studies support the status of the constituent family as the primary basis for analogical prediction. A psycholinguistic model for analogy in the mental lexicon is outlined that does not give up symbolic representations and captures nondeterministic variation.

The subject's spelling performance was affected by verious graphotactic factors, such as the distinction between consonant and vowel and graphosyllabic structure. For example, while the subject produced many consonant and vowel dedeletion errors when these were part of consonant and vowel clusters, respectively (e.g., sfondo \textrightarrow{} sondo; guinta \textrightarrow{} gunta), deletions were virtually never produced for single consonants flanked by two vowels (e.g., onesto oesto) or for single vowels flanked by two consonants (e.g., tirare trare). The dedmonstration that graphosyllabic factors affect spelling performance disconfirms the hypothesis that graphemic representations consist simply of linearly ordered sets of graphemes. It is concluded that graphemic representations are multidimensional structures: one dimension specifies the grapheme identities that comprise the spelling of a word; a second dimension specifies the consonant/vowel status of the graphemes; a third dimension represents the graphosyllabic structure of the grapheme string; and, a fourth dimension provides information about geminate features.},

When primes were presented at an SOA of 250 msec, decision latencies to verbal targets showed greatest facilitation after inflectionally related primes, significantly less after semantically transparent derived primes, and less again after semantically opaque derived primes. Both were slower than after inflectionally related primes. Stated generally, effects of semantic transparency among derivationally related verb forms were evident at long SOAs, but not at short ones. Under alphabet-alternating conditions, magnitudes of facilitation were greater overall, but the pattern was similar. The outcome suggests that restricted processing time for the prime limits the contribution of semantics to morphological processing and calls into question accounts that posit a task-invariant semantic criterion for morphological decomposition within the lexicon.

We, however, propose that the P600 is not restricted to reanalysis processes, but reflects difficulty with syntactic integration processes in general. First we discuss this integration hypothesis in terms of a sentence processing model proposed elsewhere. Next, in Experiment 1, we show that the P600 is elicited in grammatical, non-garden path sentences in which integration is more difficult (i.e., ''who'' questions) relative to a control sentence (''whether'' questions). This effect is replicated in Experiment 2. Furthermore, we directly compare the effect of difficult integration in grammatical sentences to the effect of agreement violations. The results suggest that the positivity elicited in ''who'' questions and the P600-effect elicited by agreement violations have partly overlapping neural generators. This supports the hypothesis that similar cognitive processes, i.e., integration, are involved in both first pass analysis of ''who'' questions and dealing with ungrammaticalities (reanalysis).},

Abundant evidence suggests that emotionally salient stimuli and affective states can determine how visual attention is allocated. However, the brain regions mediating the effects of attention and emotion include shared and reciprocally connected structures. This raises an intriguing question about a reciprocal effect: Does attention also influence emotional responses? Here we review a series of studies that show that indeed it does. The results indicate that attention has a negative affective impact for otherwise neutral visual stimuli (abstract patterns and unfamiliar faces) that must be ignored or otherwise inhibited during the performance of a task. Finding that selective attention has distinct affective consequences for visual stimuli represents a new, fundamental discovery about the relation between the two main systems of prioritization in the human brain.

For researchers who study verbal irony, a critical question is: How do we grasp the meaning of ironic language? The parallel-constraint-satisfaction approach holds promise as an answer to this question. By this account, multiple cues to ironic intent, such as tone of voice, incongruity, and knowledge of the speaker, are processed rapidly and in parallel and this information is coordinated with the utterance itself in order to construct a coherent interpretation that is the best fit for the activated information. Recently, research with individuals who struggle with irony comprehension (typically developing children, individuals with autism-spectrum disorder, individuals with brain injury) has provided new clues about the complex process by which ironic meaning is inferred.},

Here we uncover some of the key cognitive mechanisms that characterise this process in the domain of language learning. In five experiments adult participants learned new morphological units embedded in fictitious words created by attaching new affixes (e.g., -afe) to familiar word stems (e.g., ``sleepafe is a participant in a study about the effects of sleep''). Participants' ability to generalise semantic knowledge about the affixes was tested using tasks requiring the comprehension and production of novel words containing a trained affix (e.g., sailafe). We manipulated the delay between training and test (Experiment 1), the number of unique exemplars provided for each affix during training (Experiment 2), and the consistency of the form-to-meaning mapping of the affixes (Experiments 3\textendash 5). In a task where speeded online language processing is required (semantic priming), generalisation was achieved only after a memory consolidation opportunity following training, and only if the training included a sufficient number of unique exemplars. Semantic inconsistency disrupted speeded generalisation unless consolidation was allowed to operate on one of the two affix-meanings before introducing inconsistencies. In contrast, in tasks that required slow, deliberate reasoning, generalisation could be achieved largely irrespective of the above constraints. These findings point to two different mechanisms of generalisation that have different cognitive demands and rely on different types of memory representations.},

Exp 2 showed syllable priming effects with bisyllabic nonword targets in the naming task.

  abstract = {Electrophysiological research with event-related brain potentials (ERPs) is increasingly moving from simple, strictly orthogonal stimulation paradigms towards more complex, quasi-experimental designs and naturalistic situations that involve fast, multisensory stimulation and complex motor behavior. As a result, electrophysiological responses from subsequent events often overlap with each other. In addition, the recorded neural activity is typically modulated by numerous covariates, which influence the measured responses in a linear or non-linear fashion. Examples of paradigms where systematic temporal overlap variations and low-level confounds between conditions cannot be avoided include combined electroencephalogram (EEG)/eye-tracking experiments during natural vision, fast multisensory stimulation experiments, and mobile brain/body imaging studies. However, even ``traditional,'' highly controlled ERP datasets often contain a hidden mix of overlapping activity (e.g., from stimulus onsets, involuntary microsaccades, or button presses) and it is helpful or even necessary to disentangle these components for a correct interpretation of the results. In this paper, we introduce unfold, a powerful, yet easy-to-use MATLAB toolbox for regression-based EEG analyses that combines existing concepts of massive univariate modeling (``regression-ERPs''), linear deconvolution modeling, and non-linear modeling with the generalized additive model into one coherent and flexible analysis framework. The toolbox is modular, compatible with EEGLAB and can handle even large datasets efficiently. It also includes advanced options for regularization and the use of temporal basis functions (e.g., Fourier sets). We illustrate the advantages of this approach for simulated data as well as data from a standard face recognition experiment. In addition to traditional and non-conventional EEG/ERP designs, unfold can also be applied to other overlapping physiological signals, such as pupillary or electrodermal responses. It is available as open-source software at http://www.unfoldtoolbox.org.},

Modern engineering principles suggest that excellent EEG signals can be collected with high scalp impedance ({$\approx$}40 k{$\Omega$}) without scalp abrasion. The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of electrode-scalp impedance on EEG data quality. Methods: The first section of the paper reviews electrophysiological recording with modern high input-impedance differential amplifiers and subject isolation, and explains how scalp-electrode impedance influences EEG signal amplitude and power line noise. The second section of the paper presents an experimental study of EEG data quality as a function of scalp-electrode impedance for the standard frequency bands in EEG and event-related potential (ERP) recordings and for 60 Hz noise. Results: There was no significant amplitude change in any EEG frequency bands as scalp-electrode impedance increased from less than 10 k{$\Omega$} (abraded skin) to 40 k{$\Omega$} (intact skin). 60 Hz was nearly independent of impedance mismatch, suggesting that capacitively coupled noise appearing differentially across mismatched electrode impedances did not contribute substantially to the observed 60 Hz noise levels. Conclusions: With modern high input-impedance amplifiers and accurate digital filters for power line noise, high-quality EEG can be recorded without skin abrasion.},

Process dissociations based on experimental manipulation of variables were derived from the most relevant theoretical properties typically used to contrast the two forms of reasoning. These include processing goals (Experiment 1), cognitive resources (Experiment 2), priming (Experiment 3), and formal training (Experiment 4); the results consistently support the author's perspective. They conclude that judgment under uncertainty is neither an automatic nor a controlled process but that it reflects both processes, with each making independent contributions.},

  abstract = {Recent research has documented specific linkages between language and conceptual organization in the developing child. However, most of the evidence for these linkages derives from children who have made significant linguistic and conceptual advances. We therefore focus on the emergence of one particular linkage\textemdash the noun-category linkage\textemdash{} in infants at the early stages of lexical acquisition. We propose that when infants embark upon the process of lexical acquisition, they are initially biased to interpret a word applied to an object as referring to that object and to other members of its kind. We further propose that this initial expectation will become increasingly specific over development, as infants begin to distinguish among the grammatical categories as they are marked in their native language and assign them more specific types of meaning. To test this hypothesis, we conducted three experiments using a modified novelty-preference paradigm to reveal whether and how novel words influence object categorization in 12- to 13-month old infants. The data reveal that a linkage between words and object categories emerges early enough to serve as a guide in infants{${'}$} efforts to map words to meanings. Both nouns and adjectives focused infants{${'}$} attention on object categories, particularly at the superordinate level. Further, infants{${'}$} progress in early word learning was associated with their appreciation of this linkage between words and object categories. These results are interpreted within a developmental and cross-linguistic account of the emergence of linkages between linguistic and conceptual organization.},

There is and always has been significant common ground between art and science, encompassing not only issues of mutual concern but also modes of enquiry, many of which are far more similar than seems commonly to be supposed. A consideration of some of the similarities and differences between art and science shows that there is no fundamental division between them: both are part of one culture, not paradigms of two.

More recent approaches predict improvement when problems are presented in frequency format or refer to natural categories. The present theory focuses on sampling processes. Experiment 1 showed that a seeming advantage of frequency over probability formats is due to a confounded factor, the need to mentally transform stimulus samples. An information search paradigm was used in Experiment 2. When sampling by the predictor, the probability to be estimated, p(criterion/predictor), was conserved in the samples and judgments were quite accurate. However, when sampling by the criterion, the low base-rate event was strongly overrepresented, accounting for the entire bias.

Recently, it has been claimed that lexical space in Semitic languages (e.g., Hebrew, Arabic) is mainly determined by morphological constraints, while lexical space in Indo-European languages is mainly determined by orthographic constraints (Frost, Kugler, Deutsch, \& Forster, 2005). One of the key findings supporting the qualitative difference between Semitic and Indo-European languages is the absence of masked form priming in Hebrew/Arabic with productive words. Here we examined whether masked form priming occurs in Arabic words when one of the letters from the productive root is replaced in the prime stimulus by another letter. Results showed a significant masked form priming effect with the lexical decision task in three experiments (including yes/no, go/no-go, and sandwich priming), to a similar degree to that reported in previous research with Indo-European languages. These data support the view that the processing of word forms in Semitic vs. Indo-European languages differs more at a quantitative than at a qualitative level.

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the role of prosodic sensitivity in reading disability. The phonological processing deficit theory of dyslexia posits that deficiencies in processing oral language, particularly in segmenting spoken words into syllables and phonemes, underlie written language disabilities and may be related to deficits in speech perception. Phonological awareness, which is related to reading ability, is held to depend on complete and precise representations in the lexicon. Phonological representations may be imprecise, degraded, or incomplete in dyslexic individuals. Deficient speed in retrieving phonological codes may also contribute to impaired reading. Phonological processing studies have focused on the role of phonemic phonology in reading disability, but the role of prosodic phonology has not been well investigated. Given clinical evidence that dyslexic individuals are deficient in locating syllabic stress in words, it was hypothesized that deficient sensitivity to prosodic word structure, as well as deficient sensitivity to phonemic word structure, might play a role in reading disability. Questions were raised about differences in prosodic sensitivity between young adults with and without childhood histories of reading difficulty and about the contribution of prosodic sensitivity to proficiency in several types of reading ability. Results indicated that young adults with histories of reading difficulty are significantly lower in prosodic sensitivity compared to their peers without histories of reading difficulty. Regression analyses of reading ability found that prosodic sensitivity made an independent contribution to predicting nonword reading accuracy, oral text reading accuracy, and oral text reading comprehension, but it did not contribute to accuracy in real word reading or in proofreading for morphological errors. Word reading accuracy was predicted solely by rapid naming ability. Accuracy in proofreading for morphological errors was predicted by rapid naming ability and awareness of syllable structure. These results are consistent with models that emphasize the role of lexical encoding and rapid retrieval of lexical representations (Ellis \& Miles, 1981) and a role for phonological processing and rapid naming deficits in reading disability (Wolf \& Bowers, 1999).

  abstract = {The extent to which the processing of compounds (e.g., ``catfish'') makes recourse to morphological-level representations remains a matter of debate. Moreover, positing a morpheme-level route to complex word recognition entails not only access to morphological constituents, but also combinatoric processes operating on the constituent representations; however, the neurophysiological mechanisms subserving decomposition, and in particular morpheme combination, have yet to be fully elucidated. The current study presents electrophysiological evidence for the morpheme-based processing of both lexicalized (e.g., ``teacup'') and novel (e.g., ``tombnote'') visually-presented English compounds; these brain responses appear prior to and are dissociable from the eventual overt lexical decision response. The electrophysiological results reveal increased negativities for conditions with compound structure, including effects shared by lexicalized and novel compounds, as well as effects unique to each compound type, which may be related to aspects of morpheme combination. These findings support models positing across-the-board morphological decomposition, counter to models proposing that putatively complex words are primarily or solely processed as undecomposed representations, and motivate further electrophysiological research toward a more precise characterization of the nature and neurophysiological instantiation of complex word recognition.},

Participants became sensitive to several temporal-order statistics, both rapidly and with no overt task or explicit instructions. Sequences of shapes presented during familiarization were distinguished from novel sequences of familiar shapes, as well as from shape sequences that were seen during familiarization but less frequently than other shape sequences, demonstrating at least the extraction of joint probabilities of 2 consecutive shapes. When joint probabilities did not differ, another higher-order statistic (conditional probability) was automatically computed, thereby allowing participants to predict the temporal order of shapes. Results of a single-shape test documented that lower-order statistics were retained during the extraction of higher-order statistics. These results suggest that observers automatically extract multiple statistics of temporal events that are suitable for efficient associative learning of new temporal features.

Results show a relationship between reading ability and preference for syllabification of polysyllabic words that maximized the coda of the 1st syllable. Good reading Ss preferred an analysis that ignored the phonological syllabic structure of the word, thereby likely implying the use of orthographic representations. Poorer reading Ss were more influenced by the pronunciation of words when processing them silently, though it was unclear whether this arose from the use of phonologically-based orthographic units or from the use of their phonological mechanisms when reading.

Thus, the instrumental dimension of religious motivation in this specific religious environment seemed to be linked to a peripheral nature of one's religious sentiment. Consequently, the peripheral space could be seen as a religious sentiment, but one that is limited, not interfering into other areas of life, but remaining compartmentalized.

This study used visual lexical decision experiments with correlational designs to compare the influences of base morpheme frequency and family size on response times to derived words in English and to test for interactions of these variables with suffix productivity. Multiple regression showed that base morpheme frequency and family size were independent predictors of response times to derived words. Base morpheme frequency facilitated responses but only to productively suffixed derived words, whereas family size facilitated responses irrespective of productivity. This suggests that base morpheme frequency effects are independent of morpheme family size, depend on suffix productivity and indicate that productively suffixed words are represented as morphemes.},

Inflectional violations also elicited a late positivity (P600) effect. Derivational violations elicited an N400-like negativity effect, followed by the P600 effect. The P600 effects in the derivational and inflectional violation conditions summated linearly in the combined violation condition. The results are discussed with respect to the hypothesis that inflectional and derivational processes are independent and elicited in parallel in the online language comprehension.},

Essentially, it asserts that learning is a top-down guided process, which begins at high-level areas of the visual system, and when these do not suffice, progresses backwards to the input levels, which have a better signal-to-noise ratio. This simple concept has proved powerful in explaining a broad range of findings, including seemingly contradicting data. We now extend this concept to describe the dynamics of skill acquisition and interpret recent behavioral and electrophysiological findings.},

Stanners et al (see record 1981-00486-001) that whereas inflected words prime their unaffixed morphological relatives as effectively as do the unaffixed forms themselves, derived words are effective, but weaker, primes. The experiment also suggested, however, that this difference in priming may have an episodic origin relating to the less formal similarity of derived than of inflected words to unaffixed morphological relatives. Exp II reduced episodic contributions to priming and found equally effective priming of unaffixed words by themselves, by inflected relatives, and by derived relatives. Exps III and IV found strong priming among relatives sharing the spelling and pronunciation of the unaffixed stem morpheme, sharing spelling alone, or sharing neither formal property exactly. Overall, results with auditory and visual presentations were similar. Interpretations that repetition priming reflects either repeated access to a common lexical entry or associative semantic priming are both rejected in favor of a lexical organization in which components of a word (e.g., a stem morpheme) may be shared among distinct words without the words themselves, in any sense, sharing a "lexical entry."

Root-initial gemination (e.g., [ssm]) was judged unacceptable compared to root-final gemination (e.g., [mss]) or no gemination controls (e.g., [psm]). The sensitivity to root structure emerged regardless of the position of the root in the word. Findings demonstrated morphological decomposition. Hebrew speakers' ratings reflect a phonological constraint on the location of geminates. Being the domain of this constraint, the root morpheme must form a separate constituent in the representation of Hebrew words.

Across all studies, the most consistent findings are that children with autism perform significantly worse than controls, even though in many studies participants with mental retardation or specific language impairment do not perform as well as normally developing preschoolers. In this chapter, the authors argue for a different hypothesis regarding the relationship between language and theory of mind in autism. They propose that the acquisition of sentential complements is the key to understanding why some children with autism are able to pass false-belief tasks. Children with autism are especially dependent on language, particularly knowledge of sentential complements, to bootstrap their meta-representational capacity. This hypothesis draws on the important theoretical and empirical work conducted by Jill de Villiers and Peter de Villiers and their colleagues with normally developing preschoolers and deaf children. This chapter includes a longitudinal study conducted by the authors which focuses on the developmental relationships between the acquisition of a representational theory of mind and language in children with autism. The findings from this study indicate that knowledge of sentential complements is a significant concurrent predictor of theory-of-mind performance in children with autism.

Subjects produced more CVCs when the final consonant or whole word was repeated, but were slowed when only initial sounds or CVs were repeated. Two other experiments replicate the location-based effects and extended them to bisyllabic words. We attribute the locational effects to competition between words that are formally similar, and specifically, to competition between discrepant phonemes in the two words to occupy a particular wordframe position. The fact that only discrepant initial, but not final sounds slow production suggests that phonemes are activated sequentially, from left to right.},

Participants performed a semantic judgment task with two-word expressions consisting of literally related pairs, conventional and novel metaphoric expressions and unrelated words. We found that novel metaphors elicited smaller N400 and greater LPC amplitudes when participants had explained their meaning during a previous exposure relative to unexplained ones. Interestingly, after explaining the meanings of conventional metaphors, they elicited increased N400 and reduced LPC resembling the waveforms elicited by explained novel metaphors. Our findings suggest that people are able to conventionalize novel metaphors and change their processing mode quickly. They also show that dead metaphors retain properties that can be revived under the right circumstances. (Contains 2 figures.)},

By recording the streaming x-, y-coordinates of the computer mouse while participants move the mouse into one of multiple response alternatives, motor dynamics of the hand can reveal the time course of mental processes. MouseTracker provides researchers with fine-grained information about the real-time evolution of participant responses by sampling 60\textendash 75 times/sec the online competition between multiple response alternatives. MouseTracker allows researchers to develop and run experiments and subsequently analyze mouse trajectories in a user-interactive, graphics-based environment. Experiments may incorporate images, letter strings, and sounds. Mouse trajectories can be processed, averaged, visualized, and explored, and measures of spatial attraction/curvature, complexity, velocity, and acceleration can be computed. We describe the software and the method, and we provide details on mouse trajectory analysis. We validate the software by demonstrating the accuracy and reliability of its trajectory and reaction time data.

Disruptions to the 1st stage of syntactic parsing appear to be correlated with an early left anterior negativity, whereas disruptions to the 2nd stage might be correlated with a late posterior distributed positivity.},

The characteristics, contexts, and conditions of learners and learning are discussed. Evidence from a variety of models and frames of reference in beginning reading research is presented, including cognitive, instructional, and educational psychology; linguistics; and special education. Four areas of convergence from the studies reviewed are identified, with implications for word recognition: reading comprehension is dependent on strong word recognition skills; strong word recognition requires understanding that words can be spoken or written, print corresponds to speech, and words are composed of phonemes; alphabetic understanding facilitates word recognition; and phonological recoding combined with word frequency mediates word recognition. A chart identifies study author(s) and year, number and type of study participants, the beginning reading dimension, and the purpose of the study. (Contains 27 references.) (SW)}

  abstract = {We explored morphological decomposition in reading, the locus in the reading process in which it takes place and its nature, comparing different types of morphemes. We assessed these questions through the analysis of letter position errors in readers with letter position dyslexia(LPD). LPD is a selective impairment to letter position encoding in the early stage of word reading, which results in letter migrations (cloud-could). We used the fact that migrations in LPD occur mainly in word-interior letters, whereas exterior letters rarely migrate.The rationale was that if morphological decomposition occurs prior to letter position encoding and strips off affixes, word-interior letters adjacent to an affix (signs-signs) would become exterior following affix-stripping and hence exhibit fewer migrations. We tested 11 Hebrew readers with developmental LPD and 1 with acquired LPD in 6 experiments of reading aloud, lexical decision, and comprehension, at the single word and sentence levels. We examined migrations next to inflectional,derivational,or bound function morphemes compared with exterior letters. Root letters adjacent to inflectional and derivational morphemes were treated like middle letters, and migrated frequently, whereas root letters adjacent to bound function morphemes patterned with exterior letters, and almost never migrated. Given that LPD is a pre-lexical deficit, these results indicate that morphological decomposition takes place in an early, pre-lexical stage. Morphologically complex nonwords showed the same pattern, indicating that this decomposition is structurally, rather than lexically, driven. We suggest that letter position encoding takes place before morphological analysis, but in some cases, as with bound function morphemes, the complex word is re-analyzed as two separate words. In this reanalysis, letter positions in each constituent word are encoded separately,and hence the exterior letters of the root are treated as exterior and do not migrate},

Three types of verbs were investigated, regulars, irregulars and nonce verbs. Correct regular and irregular participles were compared with incorrect ones. For the nonce verbs, participles with the unexpected - (e)n ending were compared with the expected -t participle forms. ERP responses were very consistent across the 3 versions of the experiment: incorrect irregular participles elicited a left frontotemporal negativity, incorrect regulars produced no differences to the correct ones, and nonce verbs were associated with an N400 component but did not show a difference between expected and unexpected endings. The authors interpret the findings with respect to psycholinguistic models of morphological processing and argue that the brain processes regularly inflected words differently from irregularly inflected ones, the latter by accessing full-form entries stored in memory and the former by a computational process that decomposes complex words into stems and affixes.

Computational mechanisms for orthographic processing and orthography-tophonology translation are described. Two types of orthographic code are defined: a coarse code used to rapidly access semantic information during silent reading, and a finer-grained code used to access phonology from orthography. Furthermore, two types of phonological code are distinguished: one that is required for silent reading, and one that is required for reading aloud (articulation). The proposed architecture was initially constrained by behavioral data and purely computational considerations. The present chapter summarizes this work and describes recent research using electrophysiological recording of brain activity to further constrain the theory.}

Since a biological basis of autism was accepted, approaches from developmental cognitive neuroscience have been applied to further our understanding of the autism spectrum. The study of the behavioural and underlying cognitive deficits in autism has advanced ahead of the study of the underlying brain abnormalities and of the putative genetic mechanisms. However, advances in these fields are expected as methodological difficulties are overcome. In this paper, recent developments in the field of autism are outlined.

  abstract = {Here we present an application of an EEG processing pipeline customizing EEGLAB and FieldTrip functions, specifically optimized to flexibly analyze EEG data based on single trial information. The key component of our approach is to create a comprehensive 3-D EEG data structure including all trials and all participants maintaining the original order of recording. This allows straightforward access to subsets of the data based on any information available in a behavioral data structure matched with the EEG data (experimental conditions, but also performance indicators, such accuracy or RTs of single trials). In the present study we exploit this structure to compute linear mixed models (LMMs, using lmer in R) including random intercepts and slopes for items. This information can easily be read out from the matched behavioral data, whereas it might not be accessible in traditional ERP approaches without substantial effort. We further provide easily adaptable scripts for performing cluster-based permutation tests (as implemented in FieldTrip), as a more robust alternative to traditional omnibus ANOVAs. Our approach is particularly advantageous for data with parametric within-subject covariates (e.g., performance) and/or multiple complex stimuli (such as words, faces or objects) that vary in features affecting cognitive processes and ERPs (such as word frequency, salience or familiarity), which are sometimes hard to control experimentally or might themselves constitute variables of interest. The present dataset was recorded from 40 participants who performed a visual search task on previously unfamiliar objects, presented either visually intact or blurred. MATLAB as well as R scripts are provided that can be adapted to different datasets.},

  abstract = {In this event-related potential (ERP) study we reevaluate syntax-first approaches to sentence processing by implementing a novel paradigm in French that includes correct sentences, pure syntactic category violations, lexical-semantic anomalies, and combined anomalies. Our balanced design systematically controlled for target word (noun vs. verb) and the context immediately preceding it. Group results from 36 native speakers of Quebec French revealed that, up to 300 ms, ERPs elicited by syntactic category violations were comparable with ERP responses to correct sentences, showing that there is no early activation reflecting syntactic category identification. Instead, in response to all anomalous conditions, we observed an N400 followed by a P600. Combined anomalies yielded additive effects of syntactic category and lexical-semantic anomalies on the N400, and a large P600 effect similar to the one observed in the pure syntactic condition. These results provide strong evidence against the hypothesis that (i) syntactic categories are processed first, and (ii) that syntactic category errors ``block'' lexical-semantic processing. Further, the N400 effect in response to pure syntactic category violations reflects a mismatch detection between a predicted word-stem and the actual target. This mechanism takes place simultaneously (and potentially in parallel) with lexical-semantic processing. In contrast, an interaction of syntax and semantics for the P600 reveals that the same neurocognitive resources are recruited for syntactic and semantic integration, both promoted by the implementation of an acceptability judgement task in our design. Additional analyses of individual data complemented these observations: during sentence processing, participants did not rely on one single cognitive mechanism reflected by either the N400 or the P600 effect but on both, suggesting that the biphasic N400-P600 ERP wave can indeed be considered to be an index of phrase-structure violations in most individuals, at least if they are realized on content words.},

As a result, children must segment the utterances they hear in order to discover the sound patterns of individual words in their language. A number of computational models have been proposed to explain how children segment speech and discover words, including ten new models in the last five years. This paper reviews all proposed models and organizes them according to their fundamental segmentation strategies, their processing characteristics, and the ways in which they use memory. All proposed models are found to use one of three fundamental strategies: the utterance-boundary strategy, the predictability strategy, or the word-recognition strategy. Selected predictions of the models are explained, their performance in computer simulations is summarized, and behavioral evidence bearing on them is discussed. Finally, ideas about how these diverse models might be synthesized into one comprehensive model are offered.},

Finally, it offers a wide array of experimental methods, including masked priming, long-term priming, the monitoring of eye movements, and recording of electrophysiological measures. The cross-linguistic perspective that characterizes the research effort of the present volume, as well as the previous ones, addresses the question whether there are qualitative differences in the principles of lexical organization and lexical processing in different alphabetic orthographies which arise from qualitative differences in morphological structure. To what extent can our findings in a given language be extended to another one? Any model of reading that considers the processing of morphological information should be concerned with its applicability to various writing systems and linguistic structures. The parallel monitoring of morphological processing in reading, speech perception and production provides converging evidence regarding the nature of morphemic representations. Finally, the richness of experimental methods highlights with impressive clarity whether our theoretical conclusions reflect the idiosyncratic features of a given task or not, pinpointing with increasing precision the various stages of morphological processing and their time courses.

Previous research with conjugated verb forms has shown consistent priming from the verbal patterns, suggesting that verbal forms are automatically parsed by native speakers into their morphemic constituents. The authors investigated the decomposition process, focusing on the structural properties of verbal forms that are perceived and extracted during word recognition. The manipulations consisted of using verbal forms derived from "weak" roots that have one consonant missing in some of the forms. The results demonstrated that if 1 consonant is missing, the parsing system collapses, and there is no evidence for morphological priming. In contrast, when a random consonant is inserted into the weak form, the verbal-pattern priming re-emerges. This outcome suggests that the constraint imposed on the decomposition process is primarily structural and abstract. Moreover, the all-or-none pattern of results is characteristic of rule-based behavior and not of simple correlational systems.

Therefore, important questions are how and why a hypothesized domain-general learning mechanism systematically produces such effects.

Exp 1 revealed that priming between morphologically related words in Hebrew is determined by higher level linguistic characteristics and cannot be reduced to phonological overlap. Exp 2 confirmed that morphological priming occurs in Hebrew even when primes and targets are not semantically related but, nevertheless, increases with semantic similarity. The results support the claim that morphological priming cannot be accounted for by considering semantic and phonological factors alone, and they exemplify the potential of using both masked and cross-modal priming to examine morphological processing.

The assumptions underlying a strong phonological theory of reading are outlined, and 4 theoretical questions are examined: Is phonological recoding a mandatory phase of print processing? Is phonology necessary for lexical access? Is phonology necessary for accessing meaning? How can phonology be derived from orthographic structure?

  abstract = {In the last decade, reading research has seen a paradigmatic shift. A new wave of computational models of orthographic processing that offer various forms of noisy position or context-sensitive coding have revolutionized the field of visual word recognition. The influx of such models stems mainly from consistent findings, coming mostly from European languages, regarding an apparent insensitivity of skilled readers to letter order. Underlying the current revolution is the theoretical assumption that the insensitivity of readers to letter order reflects the special way in which the human brain encodes the position of letters in printed words. The present article discusses the theoretical shortcomings and misconceptions of this approach to visual word recognition. A systematic review of data obtained from a variety of languages demonstrates that letter-order insensitivity is neither a general property of the cognitive system nor a property of the brain in encoding letters. Rather, it is a variant and idiosyncratic characteristic of some languages, mostly European, reflecting a strategy of optimizing encoding resources, given the specific structure of words. Since the main goal of reading research is to develop theories that describe the fundamental and invariant phenomena of reading across orthographies, an alternative approach to model visual word recognition is offered. The dimensions of a possible universal model of reading, which outlines the common cognitive operations involved in orthographic processing in all writing systems, are discussed.},

A reading theory, therefore, must be a theory of the interaction of the reader with his/her linguistic environment. This outlines a novel approach to studying and modeling visual word recognition, an approach that focuses on the common cognitive principles involved in processing printed words across different writing systems. These claims were challenged by several commentaries that contested the merits of my general theoretical agenda, the relevance of the evolution of writing systems, and the plausibility of finding commonalities in reading across orthographies. Other commentaries extended the scope of the debate by bringing into the discussion additional perspectives. My response addresses all these issues. By considering the constraints of neurobiology on modeling reading, developmental data, and a large scope of cross-linguistic evidence, I argue that front-end implementations of orthographic processing that do not stem from a comprehensive theory of the complex information conveyed by writing systems do not present a viable approach for understanding reading. The common principles by which writing systems have evolved to represent orthographic, phonological and semantic information in a language reveal the critical distributional characteristics of orthographic structure that govern reading behavior. Models of reading should thus be learning models, primarily constrained by cross-linguistic developmental evidence that describes how the statistical properties of writing systems shape the characteristics of orthographic processing. When this approach is adopted a universal model of reading is possible.},

Forster and Avital Deutsch (Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 1997[Jul], Vol 23[4], 829-856). On page 854, two Hebrew words are missing from Appendix F. The corrected Appendix appears with the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]1997-05320-003[/rid].) All Hebrew words are composed of 2 interwoven morphemes: a triconsonantal root and a phonological word pattern. The lexical representations of these morphemic units were examined using masked priming. When primes and targets shared an identical word pattern, neither lexical decision nor naming of targets was facilitated. In contrast, root primes facilitated both lexical decisions and naming of target words that were derived from these roots. This priming effect proved to be independent of meaning similarity because no priming effects were found when primes and targets were semantically but not morphologically related. These results suggest that Hebrew roots are lexical units whereas word patterns are not. A working model of lexical organization in Hebrew is offered on the basis of these results. (A correction concerning this article appears in Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 1997, Vol 23(5), 1189-1191. On page 854 of the current issue, two Hebrew words are missing from Appendix F. The corrected Appendix appears in this correction.) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

We employed a visual-statistical-learning (VSL) task, monitoring our participants? implicit learning of the transitional probabilities of visual shapes. A pretest revealed that performance in the VSL task was not correlated with abilities related to a general g factor or working memory. We found that, on average, native speakers of English who more accurately picked up the implicit statistical structure embedded in the continuous stream of shapes better assimilated the Semitic structure of Hebrew words. Languages and their writing systems are characterized by idiosyncratic correlations of form and meaning, and our findings suggest that these correlations are picked up in the process of literacy acquisition, as they are picked up in any other type of learning, for the purpose of making sense of the environment.},

According to the Full Decomposition model, after the visual decomposition stage, followed by morpheme lookup, there is a final ``recombination'' stage, in which the decomposed morphemes are combined and the well-formedness of the complex form is evaluated. Here, we use MEG to provide evidence for the temporally-differentiated stages of this model. First, we demonstrate an early effect of derivational family entropy, corresponding to the stem lookup stage; this is followed by a surface frequency effect, corresponding to the later recombination stage. We also demonstrate a late effect of a novel statistical measure, semantic coherence, which quantifies the gradient semantic well-formedness of complex words. Our findings illustrate the usefulness of corpus measures in investigating the component processes within visual word recognition.},

Here we describe an account of morpho-orthographic segmentation for derivational morphology in non-agglutinative Latinate languages that underlines the key role played by edge-aligned embedded word activation. According to this account, affixes play a secondary role in the segmentation process, helping segmentation during the early processing of complex words only when embedded word activation is hindered. This provides a mechanism for initiating morpho-orthographic segmentation without appealing to specialized morphological representations. Use of edge-aligned embedded word activation is also thought to be the starting point of morpho-orthographic processing during reading development, such that efficient processing of embedded stems developmentally precedes processing of affixes as orthographic entities. Furthermore, it is the hypothesized delayed learning of orthographic representations for bound morphemes (morphemes that are not free-standing words), such as affixes, that accounts for the developmental trajectory of morpho-orthographic priming effects and the overall influence of morphological structure on processing morphologically complex stimuli. Our account of morpho-orthographic segmentation explains both the standard pattern of masked priming effects found with truly complex (e.g., farmer) and pseudo-complex (e.g., corner) words, as well as the pattern of priming effects obtained with complex nonword primes (e.g., farmage, cornity).},

High-functioning adults with ASD showed intact but reduced IAT effects relative to healthy control participants. We observed no selective attenuation of implicit social (vs. nonsocial) biases in our ASD population. To extend these results, we supplemented our healthy control data with data collected from a large online sample from the general population and explored correlations between autistic traits and IAT effects. We observed no systematic relationship between autistic traits and implicit social biases in our online and control samples. Taken together, these results suggest that implicit social biases, as measured by the IAT, are largely intact in ASD.},

Latencies did not differ at an SOA of 48 ms (Experiment 2) or with a forward mask at an SOA of 83 ms (Experiment 3). Generally, effects of semantic transparency among morphological relatives were evident at long but not at short SOAs with visual targets, regardless of prime modality.

The first experiment investigated implicit processing of the eyes and mouth in an upright face, using prime durations of 33 and 50 ms. The results demonstrate implicit processing of both the eyes and mouth, and support the configural processing theory of face processing. The second experiment used the same method with inverted faces and the third experiment was a combination of Experiments 1 and 2. The fourth experiment utilized misaligned faces as the primes. Based on the pattern of results from these experiments, we suggest that, when a face is inverted, the eyes and mouth are initially processed individually and are not linked until a later stage of processing. An upright face is proposed to be processed by analysis of its configuration, whereas an inverted face is initially processed using first-order relational information, and then converted to an upright representation and transferred to face specific regions for configural analysis.},

In the structure-mapping theory, the interpretation rules are characterized as implicit rules for mapping knowledge about a base domain into a target domain. Two important features of the theory are (a) the rules depend only on syntactic properties of the knowledge representation, and not on the specific content of the domains; and (b) the theoretical framework allows analogies to be distinguished cleanly from literal similarity statements, applications of abstractions, and other kinds of comparisons. Two mapping principles are described: (a) Relations between objects, rather than attributes of objects, are mapped from base to target; and (b) The particular relations mapped are determined by systematicity, as defined by the existence of higher-order relations.},

Deliberate metaphors are different from conventional ones, which are typically produced automatically and thoughtlessly, something that speakers and listeners, authors and readers, tacitly recognize when they engage in metaphoric discourse. This article explores some of these common assumptions about deliberate metaphor in light of contemporary research in cognitive science on meaning, consciousness and human action. My claim is that deliberate metaphors, contrary to the popular view, may not be as `deliberate' in their creation and use as is traditionally believed, and therefore are not essentially different from other forms of metaphoric language. Moreover, engaging in deliberative thought processes is often exactly the wrong way to create novel, apt verbal metaphors.},

Various evidence from cognitive linguistics, philosophy, and psychology are described in support of this claim.

The standard pragmatic view proposes that people must analyze the complete literal meaning of indirect and figurative utterances before pragmatic information is consulted to infer speakers' nonliteral messages. Most of the psycholinguistic research shows, however, that given sufficient context people understand nonliteralmeanings without first analyzing the complete literal meaning of an expression (i.e., the direct access view). Several lines of research have recently attempted to demonstrate that people still analyze aspects of literal meaning when understanding metaphors, irony, idioms, and proverbs. I critically evaluate this new work and suggest that it does not contribute sufficient evidence against the direct access view. Nonetheless, I argue that other research suggests how people analyze aspects of what speakers say as part of inferring what speakers implicate. This conclusion has several implications for specifying the role of pragmatics in ordinary utterance interpretation.},

Most linguistic and philosophical theories assume that sentences have well-specified literal meanings which represent the meaning of a sentence independent of context. Recent debate on this issue has centered on whether literal meaning can be equated with context-free meaning, or whether a sentence's literal meaning is determined only given a set of background assumptions. Neither of these positions meet the demands of a psychological theory of language understanding. Sentences do not have well-defined literal meanings, regardless of whether these are determined in light of a set of background assumptions. Moreover, the putative literal meanings of sentences do not contribute in systematic ways toward the understanding of speakers' utterance meanings. These observations suggest that the distinctions between literal and metaphoric meanings, and between semantics and pragmatics, have little psychological validity.},

My claim in this paper is that part of our ability to make sense of metaphorical language, both individual utterances and extended narratives, resides in the automatic construction of a simulation whereby we imagine performing the bodily actions referred to in the language. Thus, understanding metaphorical expressions like `grasp a concept' or `get over' an emotion involve simulating what it must be like to engage in these specific activities, even though these actions are, strictly speaking, impossible to physically perform. This process of building a simulation, one that is fundamentally embodied in being constrained by past and present bodily experiences, has specific consequences for how verbal metaphors are understood, and how cognitive scientists, more generally, characterize the nature of metaphorical language and thought.},

Many of the experimental tasks used in psychology to demonstrate the psychological reality of conceptual metaphors reflect intricate couplings between cognitive and social processes. This argument demands a reorientation in how metaphor scholars interpret empirical findings related to conceptual metaphor theory, and more broadly aims to dissolve the long-standing theoretical divide between metaphoric cognition and metaphoric communication.},

This work suggests that alternative proposals on why people speak metaphorically and behave as they do in psycholinguistic experiments are, perhaps, complementary to CMT, but do not replace the theory in any significant way.

So, understanding these particular uses of metaphor requires people to infer deliberation, which leads them to pay greater notice to these figures and enhances their understanding of the cross-domain mappings motivating metaphorical utterances. Many linguistic analyses argue that deliberate metaphor is a critical part of metaphor use, yet no empirical study has explored whether people really infer greater deliberation and cross-domain mappings when encountering so-called pragmatic signals of metaphor. The present study tested this idea and did not find evidence in support of the deliberate metaphor proposal.

The present article outlines some of the complexities in psycholinguistic studies on metaphor, and suggests ways to account for this diversity of research findings. Both linguists and psychologists should not assume that a single theoretical model will account for the complex empirical findings, because all metaphoric behaviors depend on the people being studied, the specific aspects of metaphor language employed as stimuli, the explicit experimental task, and the methods used for assessing metaphoric comprehension. People's in-the-moment metaphoric behaviors emerge from the interaction of multiple factors as part of human self-organizing processes.

In Exp I oral protocols were used to examine the processes involved in solving a problem by analogy. In all experiments Ss who first read a story about a military problem and its solution tended to generate analogous solutions to a medical problem (K. Duncker's 1945 "radiation problem"), provided they were given a hint to use the story to help solve the problem. Transfer frequency was reduced when the problem in the military story was substantially disanalogous to the radiation problem, even though the solution illustrated in the story corresponded to an effective radiation solution (Exp II). Ss in Exp III tended to generate analogous solutions to the radiation problem after providing their own solutions to the military problem. Ss were able to retrieve the story from memory and use it to generate an analogous solution, even when the critical story had been memorized in the context of 2 distractor stories (Exp IV). However, when no hint to consider the story was given, frequency of analogous solutions decreased markedly. This decrease in transfer occurred when the story analogy was presented in a recall task along with distractor stories (Exp IV), when it was presented alone, and when it was presented in between 2 attempts to solve the problem (Exp V). Component processes and strategic variations in analogical problem solving are discussed. (26 ref)},

  abstract = {The work reported here experimentally investigates a striking generalization about vocabulary acquisition: Noun learning is superior to verb learning in the earliest moments of child language development. The dominant explanation of this phenomenon in the literature invokes differing conceptual requirements for items in these lexical categories: Verbs are cognitively more complex than nouns and so their acquisition must await certain mental developments in the infant. In the present work, we investigate an alternative hypothesis; namely, that it is the information requirements of verb learning, not the conceptual requirements, that crucially determine the acquisition order. Efficient verb learning requires access to structural features of the exposure language and thus cannot take place until a scaffolding of noun knowledge enables the acquisition of clause-level syntax. More generally, we experimentally investigate the hypothesis that vocabulary acquisition takes place via an incremental constraint-satisfaction procedure that bootstraps itself into successively more sophisticated linguistic representations which, in turn, enable new kinds of vocabulary learning. If the experimental subjects were young children, it would be difficult to distinguish between this information-centered hypothesis and the conceptual change hypothesis. Therefore the experimental ``learners'' are adults. The items to be ``acquired'' in the experiments were the 24 most frequent nouns and 24 most frequent verbs from a sample of maternal speech to 18\textendash 24-month-old infants. The various experiments ask about the kinds of information that will support identification of these words as they occur in mother-to-child discourse. Both the proportion correctly identified and the type of word that is identifiable changes significantly as a function of information type. We discuss these results as consistent with the incremental construction of a highly lexicalized grammar by cognitively and pragmatically sophisticated human infants, but inconsistent with a procedure in which lexical acquisition is independent of and antecedent to syntax acquisition.},

Using both standard masked priming and the novel incremental priming technique (A. M. Jacobs et al, 1995), it is shown that net priming effects are affected not only by the number of letters shared by prime and target stimuli but also by the number of letters in the prime not present in the target. Several null results are thus explained as a tradeoff between the facilitation generated by common letters and the inhibition generated by different letters. Inhibition was significantly reduced when different letters were replaced by nonalphabetic symbols. Facilitation effects disappeared when the common letters did not have the same relative position in the prime and target strings, thus supporting a relative-position coding scheme for letters in words.

In Experiment 2 repetition effects to visual targets started later (at 200 ms), but also offset relatively later (approximately 1000 ms).

We suggest an alternative possibility: naive individuals are able to reason probabilistically when they can rely on a representation of subsets of chances or frequencies. We predicted that naive individuals solve conditional probability problems if they can infer conditional probabilities from the subset relations in their representation of the problems, and if the question put to them makes it easy to consider the appropriate subsets. The results of seven studies corroborated these predictions: when the form of the question and the structure of the problem were framed so as to activate intuitive principles based on subset relations, naive individuals solved problems, whether they were stated in terms of probabilities or frequencies. Otherwise, they failed with both sorts of information. The results contravene the frequentist hypothesis and the evolutionary account of probabilistic reasoning.},

We report two experiments that tested the implications of this ``property attribution'' view of metaphor comprehension. One implication of this view is that metaphors are not implicitly transformed into comparisons (X is like a Y), but rather are understood as what they appear to be: class-inclusion assertions. If metaphors are understood as class-inclusion assertions, they should either change meaning or become nonsensical when reversed. Experiment 1 provides evidence for this claim. A second implication of the property attribution view is that topics and vehicles provide different kinds of information to guide and constrain the comprehension process. Experiment 2 provides evidence for this claim. These findings cannot be accounted for by models which assume that metaphors are understood as implicit comparisons.},

A. Tversky's (1977) account of similarity is applied to such nonliteral similarity expressions, and is shown to apply as readily to nonliteral comparisons as to literal comparisons. But treating metaphors as comparison statements fails to account for certain important phenomena, including metaphoricity itself (the judgment that a comparison statement is nonliteral). We argue that metaphors are exactly what they appear to be: class-inclusion assertions, in which the topic of the metaphor (e.g., 'my job') is assigned to a diagnostic category (e.g., entities that confine one against one's will, are unpleasant, are difficult to escape from). In such assertions, the metaphor vehicle (e.g., 'jail') refers to that category, and at the same time is a prototypical exemplar of that category. This account of metaphor provides a basis for a theory of metaphor comprehension, and also clarifies why people use metaphors instead of similes.

However, the constellation of techniques required for scale development and evaluation can be onerous, jargon-filled, unfamiliar, and resource-intensive. Further, it is often not a part of graduate training. Therefore, our goal was to concisely review the process of scale development in as straightforward a manner as possible, both to facilitate the development of new, valid, and reliable scales, and to help improve existing ones. To do this, we have created a primer for best practices for scale development in measuring complex phenomena. This is not a systematic review, but rather the amalgamation of technical literature and lessons learned from our experiences spent creating or adapting a number of scales over the past several decades. We identified three phases that span nine steps. In the first phase, items are generated and the validity of their content is assessed. In the second phase, the scale is constructed. Steps in scale construction include pre-testing the questions, administering the survey, reducing the number of items, and understanding how many factors the scale captures. In the third phase, scale evaluation, the number of dimensions is tested, reliability is tested, and validity is assessed. We have also added examples of best practices to each step. In sum, this primer will equip both scientists and practitioners to understand the ontology and methodology of scale development and validation, thereby facilitating the advancement of our understanding of a range of health, social, and behavioral outcomes.},

In view of this, a morphological account is proposed: The grammars of these impaired individuals lack certain sublexical features, in particular [+-plural]; the notion of plurality is expressed at the level of conceptual structure. Consequently, plurals must be built through compensatory means. They may involve the concatenation of stems and thereby structurally resemble compounds, both morphologically and prosodically.

Hebrew ceased to be used as a spoken language after about the first century AD, although it was always retained as a liturgical lang. Traditional pronunciation was preserved by three groups: Ashkenazi, Sephardic Jews, \& Yemenites. The language revival was an ideological act that began in the late nineteenth century. Lang planning processes in the early twentieth century are outlined. Modern Hebrew is characterized as "a language that is part of the national self-identification of the community that uses it." The language served the purpose of providing a common lang for immigrants to Israel from throughout the world. 21 References. B. Annesser Murray},

  abstract = {The accumulated evidence that we reviewed suggests that children make use of regularities in the language--be it phonological, orthographic, and morphological--to read and spell words. Given that languages vary in the clarity with which oral language is represented in writing, one should expect the relative roles of phonological, orthographic, and morphological processing to vary accordingly. In this chapter, we focused on the relative contribution of morphological analysis and awareness to reading and spelling. We found that the morphological information in complex words can facilitate reading and spelling and that knowledge about the morphemic structure of a language can assist a child in reading, spelling, and deriving the meaning of multimorphemic words. The accumulated evidence also demonstrates that morphological awareness contributes to individual differences in reading and spelling that cannot be entirely subsumed to orthographic and phonological processing. Intervention studies on morphological knowledge (i.e., analysis and awareness), however, have not yielded the strong effects that one would have expected. We suspect that more successful intervention studies on how morphological knowledge can enhance literacy warrant a more thorough understanding of the complex interplay between morphological knowledge and a number of different variables such as oral vocabulary, phonological and orthographic awareness, and reading exposure. Given the demonstrated facilitative effects that morphological information can have on reading and spelling along with the particular difficulties that multimorphemic words can pose, researchers argue that systematic and sequential instruction of morphology is needed during the elementary years of schooling. Morphological rules, however, are currently not taught or taught partially to elementary school children. Perhaps, as Carlisle suggests, this is partly due to the fact that educators are more familiar with concepts of phonemes and phoneme awareness than with concepts of morphemes and morphemic awareness. This may change in time as we cumulate stronger scientific evidence on the valuable role of morphological knowledge in reading and spelling.},

  abstract = {Considerable behavioral research has demonstrated that the visual word recognition system is sensitive to morphological structure. It has typically been assumed that analysis of morphologically complex words occurs only when the meaning of these words can be derived from the meanings of their constituents (e.g., hunter = hunt + er). However, results from recent behavioral research using the masked priming technique have demonstrated that morphological analysis can occur at an earlier orthographic level, in cases in which the meanings of complex words cannot be derived from their constituents (e.g., corner = corn + er). Here, we combine the logic of behavioral masked priming with the neurophysiological phenomenon of functional magnetic resonance imaging priming suppression to look for evidence of nonsemantic morphological priming at the neural level. Both behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging results indicated priming effects associated with the mere appearance of morphological structure (corner-CORN). In addition, these effects were distinguishable from lexical-semantic effects (bucket-PAIL) and orthographic effects (brothel-BROTH). Three left-lateralized occipito-temporal regions showed sensitivity to early morphological components of visual word recognition. Two of these regions also showed orthographic priming (,\`a\textordmasculine BA 37, peak: -48 -60 -17; ,\`a\textordmasculine BA 19, peak: -40 -77 -1), whereas one was sensitive only to morphological similarity between primes and targets (,\`a\textordmasculine BA 19, peak: -37 -67 -7). These findings provide a neurobiological basis for a purely structural morphemic segmentation mechanism operating at early stages of visual word recognition.

The first covers four competing approaches to mentalizing such as the theory-theory, modularity theory, rationality theory, and simulation theory. The second classification is the first-person/third-person contrast. Jerry Fodor claimed that commonsense psychology is so good at helping predict behavior that it is practically invisible. It works well because the intentional states it posits genuinely exist and possess the properties generally associated with them. The modularity model has two principal components. First, whereas the child-scientist approach claims that mentalizing utilizes domain-general cognitive equipment, the modularity approach posits one or more domain-specific modules, which use proprietary representations and computations for the mental domain. Second, the modularity approach holds that these modules are innate cognitive structures, which mature or come on line at preprogrammed stages and are not acquired through learning. The investigators concluded that autism impairs a domain-specific capacity dedicated to mentalizing. Gordon, Jane Heal, and Alvin Goldman explained simulation theory in such a way that mind readers simulate a target by trying to create similar mental states of their own as proxies or surrogates of those of the target. These initial pretend states are fed into the mind reader's own cognitive mechanisms to generate additional states, some of which are then imputed to the target.},

Seventeen adults completed tests of visual SL, receptive vocabulary, grammatical ability, and sentence completion. Response times and ERPs showed that SL is related to receptive vocabulary and grammatical ability. ERPs indicated that the relationship between SL and grammatical ability was independent of attention while the association between SL and receptive vocabulary depended on attention. The implications of these dissociative relationships in terms of underlying mechanisms of SL and language are discussed.

Enhanced priming for cognates was found with L1 (dominant language) primes, but unlike previous results, it was not found with L2 (nondominant language) primes. Priming was also obtained for noncognates, whereas previous studies showed unstable effects for such stimuli. The authors interpret the results in a dual-lexicon model by suggesting that (a) both orthographic and phonological overlap are needed to establish shared lexical entries for cognates (and hence also symmetric cognate priming), and (b) script differences facilitate rapid access by providing a cue to the lexical processor that directs access to the proper lexicon, thus producing stable noncognate priming. The asymmetrical cognate effect obtained with different scripts may be attributed to an overreliance on phonology in L2 reading.},

The article contributes to the ongoing debates by reporting the results of two experiments on Russian verb generation and recognition in a lexical decision task (LDT) with priming by highly proficient late L2 learners, early interrupted (heritage) learners, and adult native speakers of Russian. Inflected verbs varying in regularity, type, and token (lemma) frequency were used. The experiments document the role of obligatory decomposition and complex allomorphy involved in (de)composition and mapping as well as type and token frequency in L1 and L2 verb generation and lexical access, with no sharp division between regular and irregular verbs. The results are inconsistent with either the dual-system or the single-system approach to morphological processing, and are compatible with ``hybrid'' theories combining rule-based decomposition and input-frequency-based probabilistic mechanisms. All of the verb types showed priming effects, both in native and nonnative lexical access. However, the degree of facilitation depended on decomposition costs for different verb types only in nonnative participants. The study also shows differences in early (heritage) and late L2 learners. In the production task, heritage speakers outperformed L2 learners in real, but not novel, verb generation and in the use of the regular default pattern, whereas L2 learners showed an advantage in the use of the cue-based complex morphological pattern. In the priming task, heritage speakers were faster than late L2 learners and insensitive to morphological complexity, whereas L2 learners showed longer latencies in response to the verbs with complex inflectional morphology. These differences are associated with the differences in their respective language learning backgrounds. It is tentatively suggested that these two groups of learners may rely on different processing mechanisms and, possibly, neural paths.

This article outlines the potential use and insights from the first entirely standardized and centralized database, which integrates information from neuroimaging measures (EEG, event related potential (ERP), structural/functional MRI), arousal (skin conductance responses (SCR)s, heart rate, respiration), neuropsychological and personality tests, genomics and demographics: The Brain Resource International Database. It comprises data from over 2,000 ``normative'' subjects and a growing number of patients with neurological and psychiatric illnesses, acquired from over 50 laboratories (in the USA, United Kingdom, Holland, South Africa, Israel and Australia), all with identical equipment and experimental procedures. Three primary goals of this database are to quantify individual differences in normative brain function, to compare an individual's performance to their database peers, and to provide a robust normative framework for clinical assessment and treatment prediction. We present three example demonstrations in relation to these goals. First, we show how consistent age differences may be quantified when large subject numbers are available, using EEG and ERP data from nearly 2,000 stringently screened normative subjects. Second, the use of a normalization technique provides a means to compare clinical subjects (50 ADHD subjects in this study) to the normative database with the effects of age and gender taken into account. Third, we show how a profile of EEG/ERP and autonomic measures potentially provides a means to predict treatment response in ADHD subjects. The example data consists of EEG under eyes open and eyes closed and ERP data for auditory oddball, working memory and Go-NoGo paradigms. Autonomic measures of skin conductance (tonic skin conductance level, SCL, and phasic skin conductance responses, SCRs) were acquired simultaneously with central EEG/ERP measures. The findings show that the power of large samples, tested using standardized protocols, allows for the quantification of individual differences that can subsequently be used to control such variation and to enhance the sensitivity and specificity of comparisons between normative and clinical groups. In terms of broader significance, the combination of size and multidimensional measures tapping the brain's core cognitive competencies, may provide a normative and evidence-based framework for individually-based assessments in ``Personalized Medicine.''},

Overall, our findings provide support for a form of morphemic decomposition that is based on the mere appearance of morphological complexity (e.g., Rastle, Davis, \& New, 2004), and demonstrate that this form of morphemic decomposition is robust to regular orthographic alterations that occur in morphologically complex words.

  abstract = {The P600 is an event-related brain potential (ERP) typically associated with the processing of grammatical anomalies or incongruities. A similar response has also been observed in fully acceptable long-distance wh-dependencies. Such findings raise the question of whether these ERP responses reflect common underlying processes, and what might be the specific mechanisms that are shared between successful processing of well-formed sentences and the detection and repair of syntactic anomalies. The current study presents a comparison of the ERP responses elicited by syntactic violations, garden path sentences, and long-distance wh-dependencies, using maximally similar materials in a within-subjects design. Results showed that a P600 component was elicited by syntactic violations and garden path sentences, but was less robustly elicited in the long-distance wh-dependency condition. Differences in the scalp topography, onset and duration of the P600 effects are characterised in terms of the syntactic operations involved in building complex syntactic structures, with particular attention to retrieval processes, which control the latency of the P600, and structure building processes, which control its duration and amplitude.},

  abstract = {When reading sentences with an anaphoric reference to a subject antecedent, repeated-name anaphors result in slower reading times relative to pronouns (the Repeated Name Penalty: RNP), and overt pronouns are read slower than null pronouns (the Overt Pronoun Penalty: OPP). Because in most languages previously tested, the grammatical subject is typically also the discourse topic it remains unclear whether these effects reflect anaphors' subject-hood or their topic-hood. To address this question we conducted a self-paced reading experiment in Japanese, a language which morphologically marks both subjects and topics overtly. Our results show that both repeated-name topic-subject anaphors and repeated-name non-topic-subject anaphors exhibit the RNP and that both overt-pronoun topic-subject and overt-pronoun non-topic-subject anaphors show the OPP. However, a detailed examination of performance revealed an interaction between the anaphor topic marking, reference form, and the antecedent's grammatical status, indicating that the effect of the antecedent's grammatical status is strongest for null pronoun and repeated name subject anaphors and that the overt form most similar to null pronouns is the repeated name topic anaphor. We discuss the implications of these findings for theories of anaphor processing.},

  abstract = {In the present theoretical note we examine how different learning constraints, thought to be involved in optimizing the mapping of print to meaning during reading acquisition, might shape the nature of the orthographic code involved in skilled reading. On the one hand, optimization is hypothesized to involve selecting combinations of letters that are the most informative with respect to word identity (diagnosticity constraint), and on the other hand to involve the detection of letter combinations that correspond to pre-existing sublexical phonological and morphological representations (chunking constraint). These two constraints give rise to two different kinds of prelexical orthographic code, a coarse-grained and a fine-grained code, associated with the two routes of a dual-route architecture. Processing along the coarse-grained route optimizes fast access to semantics by using minimal subsets of letters that maximize information with respect to word identity, while coding for approximate within-word letter position independently of letter contiguity. Processing along the fined-grained route, on the other hand, is sensitive to the precise ordering of letters, as well as to position with respect to word beginnings and endings. This enables the chunking of frequently co-occurring contiguous letter combinations that form relevant units for morpho-orthographic processing (prefixes and suffixes) and for the sublexical translation of print to sound (multi-letter graphemes).},

In contrast, neither group gave evidence of distinguishing utterances from two foreign languages. A series of control experiments confirmed that the ability to distinguish utterances from two different languages appears to depend upon some familiarity with at least one of the two languages. Finally, two experiments with low-pass-filtered versions of the samples replicated the main findings of discrimination of the native language utterances. These latter results suggest that the basis for classifying utterances from the native language may be provided by prosodic cues.

Three mechanisms were identified that predict distinct facilitatory or inhibitory effects of each variable. The lexical competition account predicts overall inhibitory effects of neighbourhood density. The global activation (familiarity) account predicts overall facilitatory effects of neighbourhood density. Finally, the cross-code consistency account predicts an interaction, with inhibition of phonological neighbours in sparse orthographic regions and facilitation of phonological neighbours in dense orthographic regions. In Experiment 1 (lexical decision), a cross-over interaction was indeed found, supporting the prediction of the cross-code consistency account. In Experiment 2, this cross-over interaction was exaggerated by adding pseudohomo-phone stimuli (e.g., brane) among the nonword targets. Finally, in Experiment 3 (progressive demasking), we tried to shift the balance between inhibitory and facilitatory mechanisms by using a perceptual identification task. As predicted, the inhibitory effects of phonological neighbourhood were amplified, whereas the facilitatory effects disappeared. We conclude that the level of compatibility across co-activated orthographic and phonological representations is a major causal factor underlying this pattern of effects.},

The career of metaphor hypothesis offers a unified theoretical framework that can resolve the debate between comparison and categorization models of metaphor. This account further suggests that whether metaphors are processed directly or indirectly, and whether they operate at the level of individual concepts or entire conceptual domains, will depend both on their degree of conventionality and on their linguistic form.

Further investigation of this marked dissociation across experimental tasks showed that word naming is particularly sensitive to shared onsets in the masked priming paradigm and that robust rhyme priming does occur when primes and targets have different onsets. The lexical decision task, on the other hand, showed priming effects independently of whether prime and targets shared onsets.

For participial forms, L2 learners were found to widely generalize the -t suffixation rule in a nonce-word elicitation task, and in the ERP experiment they showed an anterior negativity followed by a P600 both results resembling previous findings from native speakers of German on the same materials. For plural formation, the L2 learners displayed different preference patterns for regular and irregular forms in an offline plural judgment task. Regular and irregular plural forms also differed clearly with regard to their brain responses. Whereas overapplications of the -s plural rule produced a P600 component, overapplications of irregular patterns elicited an N400. In contrast to native speakers of German, however, the L2 learners did not show an anterior negativity for -s plural overapplications. Taken together, the results show clear dissociations between regular and irregular inflection for both morphological subsystems. We argue that the two processing routes posited by dualmechanism models of inflection (lexical storage and morphological decomposition) are also employed by L2 learners.}

  abstract = {The processing of a written word can be facilitated by the brief prior presentation of an orthographically similar stimulus. However, for adults, this masked form-priming effect does not occur if the target looks like many other words (i.e. if it has many neighbours). The usual interpretation of this result is that the adult word recognition system is tuned to the differing discrimination demands of words: If a word looks like many others, a more precise recognition procedure is required than if it is orthographically distinctive. This theory has developmental implications: Children should show more form priming for high neighbourhood words than adults and should show a gradual reduction in priming as their written vocabularies become larger. Masked form priming was examined in three groups of developing readers, from grades 2, 4 and 6, and a group of adults. In a lexical decision task, the children showed significantly greater priming overall than the adults for high N words. However, the predicted gradual attenuation across age was not found. Supplementary analyses suggested that the adaptation to lexical density may not occur until a somewhat more advanced stage of reading than we had first expected.},

  abstract = {Monkey See, Monkey Read An orthographic object such as a set of letters, and the ability to recognize such sets as words, is a key component of reading. The ability to develop these skills has often been attributed to the prior acquisition of a complex language. For example, we learn how letters sound and thus recognize when a particular letter makes up part of a word. However, orthographic processing is also a visual process, because we learn to recognize words as discrete objects, and the ability to read may thus be related to an ability to recognize and classify objects. Grainger et al. (p. 245; see the Perspective by Platt and Adams) tested orthographic skills in baboons. Captive, but freely ranging, baboons were trained to distinguish real English words from combinations of similar letters that are not words, and they were able to distinguish real words with remarkable accuracy. Thus, a basic ability to recognize words as objects does not require complex linguistic understanding. Skilled readers use information about which letters are where in a word (orthographic information) in order to access the sounds and meanings of printed words. We asked whether efficient processing of orthographic information could be achieved in the absence of prior language knowledge. To do so, we trained baboons to discriminate English words from nonsense combinations of letters that resembled real words. The results revealed that the baboons were using orthographic information in order to efficiently discriminate words from letter strings that were not words. Our results demonstrate that basic orthographic processing skills can be acquired in the absence of preexisting linguistic representations. Baboons discriminate words from nonwords on the basis of spelling. Baboons discriminate words from nonwords on the basis of spelling.},

Enchainment involves the resyllabification of a word-final consonant across a syllable boundary (e.g., in chaque avion, the /k/ crosses the syllable boundary to become syllable-initial). Liaison involves a further process of realization of a latent consonant, alongside resyllabification (e.g., the /t/ in petit avion). If the syllable is a dominant unit of perception in French (J. Mehler et al, 1981), these processes should cause problems for recognition of the following word. A cross-modal priming experiment showed no cost attached to either type of resyllabification in terms of reduced activation of the following word. Furthermore, word- and sequence-monitoring experiments again showed no cost and suggested that the recognition of vowel-initial words may be facilitated when they are preceded by a word that had undergone resyllabification through enchainment or liaison. The authors examined the sources of information that could underpin facilitation and propose a refinement of the syllable's role in the perception of French speech.

The question is whether structural invariance of the morphological category (i.e., lack of allomorphy) would affect the processing of Finnish derived words. A series of four visual lexical decision experiments in which alternatively surface and base frequency was manipulated showed that the two invariant suffixes, namely denominal \textendash stO and deadjectival \textendash hkO, showed reliable effects of base frequency, whereas for the two categories with suffix allomorphy, deverbal \textendash Us and deadjectival \textendash (U)Us, only surface frequency played a role. A further experiment showed that even with the most frequent variant of \textendash (U)Us, namely \textendash Ude-, response latencies were a function of surface frequency only. It is shown that neither the results from the experiments here nor previous findings from processing Finnish words can be accounted for by suffix frequency, the frequency ratio between the derived word and its base, or morphological productivity in any straightforward manner. We conclude that the lack of allomorphy, that is, structural invariance, significantly adds to affixal salience and therefore enhances morphological decomposition. The implications of this finding for models of lexical processing are discussed.},

However, considerable evidence now supports the view that social behavior often operates in an implicit or unconscious fashion. The identifying feature of implicit cognition is that past experience influences judgment in a fashion not introspectively known by the actor. The present conclusion--that attitudes, self-esteem, and stereotypes have important implicit modes of operation--extends both the construct validity and predictive usefulness of these major theoretical constructs of social psychology. Methodologically, this review calls for increased use of indirect measures--which are imperative in studies of implicit cognition. The theorized ordinariness of implicit stereotyping is consistent with recent findings of discrimination by people who explicitly disavow prejudice. The finding that implicit cognitive effects are often reduced by focusing judges' attention on their judgment task provides a basis for evaluating applications (such as affirmative action) aimed at reducing such unintended discrimination.},

Such myths about language allow linguistic discrimination to continue in schools. The author debunks these myths and provides suggestions for teachers in terms of how to work with dominant and nondominant English varieties in their classrooms.},

A review of the experimental evidence, however, leads to the conclusion that P3 is not a sensitive tool for separating between stimulus and response-related processes. Rather, it appears that P3 latency is a sensitive index of any response-time changes when response times in the fast condition are brief, with its sensitivity decreasing when response times in the fast condition get longer. This regularity was confirmed by a detailed analysis of the published evidence from Steinberg's task and was not attributable to speed-accuracy trade-off or to different methods of parameterization. The structures generating the scalp P3b are involved both in stimulus processing and in response selection. Response selection may exert its effect on P3 in one of two ways: either directly, fully delaying P3 latency, or affecting a second P3 component (P-CR) only, thus having an attenuated effect on P3 latency.},

  abstract = {A new view of the functional role of the left anterior cortex in language use is proposed. The experimental record indicates that most human linguistic abilities are not localized in this region. In particular, most of syntax (long thought to be there) is not located in Broca's area and its vicinity (operculum, insula, and subjacent white matter). This cerebral region, implicated in Broca's aphasia, does have a role in syntactic processing, but a highly specific one: It is the neural home to receptive mechanisms involved in the computation of the relation between transformationally moved phrasal constituents and their extraction sites (in line with the Trace-Deletion Hypothesis). It is also involved in the construction of higher parts of the syntactic tree in speech production. By contrast, basic combinatorial capacities necessary for language processing \textendash{} for example, structure-building operations, lexical insertion \textendash{} are not supported by the neural tissue of this cerebral region, nor is lexical or combinatorial semantics. The dense body of empirical evidence supporting this restrictive view comes mainly from several angles on lesion studies of syntax in agrammatic Broca's aphasia. Five empirical arguments are presented: experiments in sentence comprehension, cross-linguistic considerations (where aphasia findings from several language types are pooled and scrutinized comparatively), grammaticality and plausibility judgments, real-time processing of complex sentences, and rehabilitation. Also discussed are recent results from functional neuroimaging and from structured observations on speech production of Broca's aphasics. Syntactic abilities are nonetheless distinct from other cognitive skills and are represented entirely and exclusively in the left cerebral hemisphere. Although more widespread in the left hemisphere than previously thought, they are clearly distinct from other human combinatorial and intellectual abilities. The neurological record (based on functional imaging, split-brain and right-hemisphere-damaged patients, as well as patients suffering from a breakdown of mathematical skills) indicates that language is a distinct, modularly organized neurological entity. Combinatorial aspects of the language faculty reside in the human left cerebral hemisphere, but only the transformational component (or algorithms that implement it in use) is located in and around Broca's area.}

In Experiment 1 we employed the translation recognition task, a task that forces the participants to activate both language systems simultaneously. In this task the processing of interlexical homographs was inhibited substantially compared to the processing of matched control words, especially when the homograph reading to be selected was the less frequent of the homograph's two readings. In Experiments 2 and 3 we used the lexical decision task: In one condition we asked the participants to categorize letter strings as words or nonwords in Dutch; in a second condition we asked them to do so in English. The makeup of the stimulus set in Experiment 2 permitted the participants to ignore the instructions and to instantiate the task in a language-neutral form-that is, to categorize the letter strings as words in either Dutch or English. Under these circumstances a small, frequency-dependent inhibitory effect for homographs was obtained, but only in condition Dutch. In Experiment 3 the participants were forced in a language-specific processing mode by the inclusion of "nonwords" that were in fact words in the non-target language. Large frequency-dependent inhibitory effects for homographs were now obtained in both language conditions. The combined results are interpreted as support for the view that bilingual lexical access is non-selective.},

  abstract = {How do speakers predict the syntax of a verb from its meaning? Traditional theories posit that syntactically relevant information about semantic arguments consists of a list of thematic roles like ``agent'', ``theme'', and ``goal'', which are linked onto a hierarchy of grammatical positions like subject, object and oblique object. For verbs involving motion, the entity caused to move is defined as the ``theme'' or ``patient'' and linked to the object. However, this fails for many common verbs, as in {${_\ast}$}fill water into the glass and {${_\ast}$}cover a sheet onto the bed. In more recent theories verbs' meanings are multidimensional structures in which the motions, changes, and other events can be represented in separate but connected substructures; linking rules are sensitive to the position of an argument in a particular configuration. The verbs' object would be linked not to the moving entity but to the argument specified as ``affected'' or caused to change as the main event in the verbs' meaning. The change can either be one of location, resulting from motion in a particular manner, or of state, resulting from accomodating or reacting to a substance. For example, pour specifies how a substance moves (downward in a stream), so its substance argument is the object (pour the water/{${_\ast}$}glass); fill specifies how a container changes (from not full to full), so its stationary container argument is the object (fill the glass/{${_\ast}$}water). The newer theory was tested in three experiments. Children aged 3;4\textendash 9;4 and adults were taught made-up verbs, presented in a neutral syntactic context (this is mooping), referring to a transfer of items to a surface or container. Subjects were tested on their willingness to encode the moving items or the surface as the verb's object. For verbs where the items moved in a particular manner (e. g., zig-zagging), people were more likely to express the moving items as the object; for verbs where the surface changed state (e. g., shape, color, or fullness), people were more likely to express the surface as the object. This confirms that speakers are not confined to labeling moving entities as ``themes'' or ``patients'' and linking them to the grammatical object; when a stationary entity undergoes a state change as the result of a motion, it can be represented as the main affected argument and thereby linked to the grammatical object instead.},

The frontal asymmetry was correlated with reading and spelling scores, even after controlling for age. The distribution and onset of the more posterior rhyming effect were stable across age groups, suggesting that phonological matching relied on similar neural systems across these ages. Behaviorally, both reaction times and accuracy improved with age.

  abstract = {Neuropsychological research investigating mental grammar and lexicon has largely been based on the processing of regular and irregular inflection. Past tense inflection of regular verbs is assumed to be generated by a syntactic rule (e.g., show-ed), whereas irregular verbs consist of rather unsystematic alternations (e.g., caught) represented as lexical entries. Recent morphological accounts, however, hold that irregular inflection is not entirely rule-free but relies on morphological principles. These subregularities are computed by the syntactic system. We tested this latter hypothesis by examining alternations of irregular German verbs as well as pseudowords using ERPs. Participants read series of irregular verb inflection including present tense, past participle, and past tense forms embedded in minimal syntactic contexts. The critical past tense form was correct (e.g., er sang [he sang]) or incorrect by being either partially consistent (e.g., *er sung [*he sung]) or inconsistent (e.g., *er sing [*he sing]) with the proposed morphological principles. Correspondingly, in a second experimental block, pseudowords (e.g., tang/*tung/*ting) were presented. ERPs for real words revealed a biphasic ERP pattern consisting of a negativity and P600 for both incorrect forms in comparison to the correct equivalents. Most interestingly, the P600 amplitude for the incorrect forms was gradually modulated by the type of anomaly with medium amplitude for consistent past tense forms and largest amplitude for inconsistent past tense forms. ERPs for pseudoword past tense forms showed a similar gradual modulation of N400. The findings support the assumption that irregular verbs are processed by rule-based mechanisms because of subregularities of their past tense inflection.},

This investigation focused on how morphological knowledge in this polysynthetic language is affected across various levels of language attrition by employing a morphological segmentation task and an off-line lexical decision task. 10 native speakers (aged 45-over 60 yrs) of Dene served as experimental participants. The paper discusses the manner in which these tasks target different aspects of morphological ability and then turns to methodological issues associated with conducting psycholinguistic studies with language users that differ in levels of age, education, literacy, and bilingualism (Dene-English). Finally, the authors report on the challenges of doing psycholinguistic research outside the confines of a university setting and make some recommendations to other researchers who might wish to undertake similar studies (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2002 APA, all rights reserved).},

Why this trait has been maintained in the population is uncertain but this polymorphism may influence food selection, nutritional status or thyroid metabolism. The gene product that gives rise to this phenotype is unknown, and its characterization would provide insight into the mechanism of bitter taste perception. Although this trait is often considered a simple Mendelian trait, i.e. one gene-two alleles, a recent linkage study found a major locus on chromosome 5p15 and evidence for an additional locus on chromosome 7. The development of methods to identify these genes will provide a good stepping-stone between single-gene disorders and polygenic traits.},

For 50 years, the RAT has been used to measure creativity. Each RAT question presents three cue words that are linked by a fourth word, which is the correct answer. We hypothesized that individuals perform poorly on the RAT when they are biased to consider high-frequency candidate answers. To assess this hypothesis, we tested individuals with 48 RAT questions and required speeded responding to encourage guessing. Results supported our hypothesis. We generated a norm-based model of the RAT using a high-dimensional semantic space, and this model accurately identified correct answers. A frequency-biased model that included different levels of bias for high-frequency candidate answers explained variance for both correct and incorrect responses. Providing new insight into the nature of creativity, the model explains why some RAT questions are more difficult than others, and why some people perform better than others on the RAT.},

In the psycholinguistic literature, one aspect of this debate concerns the psychological reality of the morphological complexity difference between compound words (teacup) and single words (crescent). The present study investigates morphological decomposition in compound words using visual lexical decision with simultaneous magnetoencephalography (MEG), comparing compounds, single words, and pseudomorphemic foils. The results support an account of lexical processing which includes early decomposition of morphologically complex words into constituents. The behavioural differences suggest internally structured representations for compound words, and the early effects of constituents in the electrophysiological signal support the hypothesis of early morphological parsing. These findings add to a growing literature suggesting that the lexicon includes structured representations, consistent with previous findings supporting early morphological parsing using other tasks. The results do not favour two putative constraints, word length and lexicalisation, on early morphological-structure based computation.},

  abstract = {The ability to anticipate forthcoming events has clear evolutionary advantages, and predictive successes or failures often entail significant psychological and physiological consequences. In music perception, the confirmation and violation of expectations are critical to the communication of emotion and aesthetic effects of a composition. Neuroscientific research on musical expectations has focused on harmony. Although harmony is important in Western tonal styles, other musical traditions, emphasizing pitch and melody, have been rather neglected. In this study, we investigated melodic pitch expectations elicited by ecologically valid musical stimuli by drawing together computational, behavioural, and electrophysiological evidence. Unlike rule-based models, our computational model acquires knowledge through unsupervised statistical learning of sequential structure in music and uses this knowledge to estimate the conditional probability (and information content) of musical notes. Unlike previous behavioural paradigms that interrupt a stimulus, we devised a new paradigm for studying auditory expectation without compromising ecological validity. A strong negative correlation was found between the probability of notes predicted by our model and the subjectively perceived degree of expectedness. Our electrophysiological results showed that low-probability notes, as compared to high-probability notes, elicited a larger (i) negative ERP component at a late time period (400\textendash 450~ms), (ii) beta band (14\textendash 30~Hz) oscillation over the parietal lobe, and (iii) long-range phase synchronization between multiple brain regions. Altogether, the study demonstrated that statistical learning produces information-theoretic descriptions of musical notes that are proportional to their perceived expectedness and are associated with characteristic patterns of neural activity.},

Yet neuroscience and behaviourist psychology have traditionally dismissed the topic as unscientific, perhaps because the mechanisms that cause actions have long been unclear. However, new research has identified networks of brain areas, including the pre-supplementary motor area, the anterior prefrontal cortex and the parietal cortex, that underlie voluntary action. These areas generate information for forthcoming actions, and also cause the distinctive conscious experience of intending to act and then controlling one's own actions. Volition consists of a series of decisions regarding whether to act, what action to perform and when to perform it. Neuroscientific accounts of voluntary action may inform debates about the nature of individual responsibility.},

Recently, researchers have started to address this question by applying sophisticated pattern-classification algorithms to distributed (multi-voxel) patterns of functional MRI data, with the goal of decoding the information that is represented in the subject's brain at a particular point in time. This multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) approach has led to several impressive feats of mind reading. More importantly, MVPA methods constitute a useful new tool for advancing our understanding of neural information processing. We review how researchers are using MVPA methods to characterize neural coding and information processing in domains ranging from visual perception to memory search.},

The RP tended to occur later on trials with early awareness of movement initiation than on trials with late awareness, ruling out the RP as a cause of our awareness of movement intiation.

The grammatical violations elicited a Syntactic Positive Shift (P600/SPS), 500 ms after the onset of the word that rendered the sentence ungrammatical. The P600/SPS consisted of two phases, an early phase with a relatively equal anterior-posterior distribution and a later phase with a strong posterior distribution. We interpret the first phase as an indication of structural integration complexity, and the second phase as an indication of failing parsing operations and/or an attempt at reanalysis. In the second experiment the same syntactic violations were presented in sentences spoken at a normal rate and with normal intonation. These violations elicited a P600/SPS with the same onset as was observed for the reading of these sentences.

  abstract = {This study investigated the effects of combined semantic and syntactic violations in relation to the effects of single semantic and single syntactic violations on language-related event-related brain potential (ERP) effects (N400 and P600/ SPS). Syntactic violations consisted of a mismatch in grammatical gender or number features of the definite article and the noun in sentence-internal or sentence-final noun phrases (NPs). Semantic violations consisted of semantically implausible adjective\textendash noun combinations in the same NPs. Combined syntactic and semantic violations were a summation of these two respective violation types. ERPs were recorded while subjects read the sentences with the different types of violations and the correct control sentences. ERP effects were computed relative to ERPs elicited by the sentence-internal or sentence-final nouns. The size of the N400 effect to the semantic violation was increased by an additional syntactic violation (the syntactic boost). In contrast, the size of the P600/ SPS to the syntactic violation was not affected by an additional semantic violation. This suggests that in the absence of syntactic ambiguity, the assignment of syntactic structure is independent of semantic context. However, semantic integration is influenced by syntactic processing. In the sentence-final position, additional global processing consequences were obtained as a result of earlier violations in the sentence. The resulting increase in the N400 amplitude to sentence-final words was independent of the nature of the violation. A speeded anomaly detection task revealed that it takes substantially longer to detect semantic than syntactic anomalies. These results are discussed in relation to the latency and processing characteristics of the N400 and P600/SPS effects. Overall, the results reveal an asymmetry in the interplay between syntax and semantics during on-line sentence comprehension.},

Unification is characterized by a high-speed temporal profile including both prediction and integration of retrieved lexical elements. A meta-analysis of numerous neuroimaging studies reveals a clear dorsal/ventral gradient in both left inferior frontal cortex and left posterior temporal cortex, with dorsal foci for syntactic processing and ventral foci for semantic processing. In addition to core areas for unification, further networks need to be recruited to realize language-driven communication to its full extent. One example is the theory of mind network, which allows listeners and readers to infer the intended message (speaker meaning) from the coded meaning of the linguistic utterance. This indicates that sensorimotor simulation cannot handle all of language processing.},

We refer to this electro-physiological manifestation of parsing as the Syntactic Positive Shift (SPS). The SPS was observed in an experiment in which no task demands, other than to read the input, were imposed on the subjects. The pattern of responses to the different kinds of syntactic violations suggests that the SPS indicates the impossibility for the parser to assign the preferred structure to an incoming string of words, irrespective of the specific syntactic nature of this preferred structure. The implications of these findings for further research on parsing are discussed.},

By means of re-analyses of previously published data on Dutch words we show that the information residual outperforms the combination of traditional token- and type-based counts in predicting response latencies in visual lexical decision, and at the same time provides a parsimonious account of inflectional, derivational, and compounding processes.},

Predictions tested were that there would be a difference in slope, a difference in the mean while controlling for slope, or both. The results showed large linear effects for level of education and for age of immigration, but a negligible amount of additional variance was accounted for when the parameters for difference in slope and difference in means were estimated. Thus, the pattern of decline in second-language acquisition failed to produce the discontinuity that is an essential hallmark of a critical period. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR},

ERPs were averaged as a function of word class (open vs closed) and grammatical category (articles, nouns, verbs, etc.). Regression analyses indicated that the latency of an early-occurring negative component was highly correlated with the mean length and normative frequency of words in each grammatical category. Stronger correlations were observed in the scrambled prose condition than in the normal prose condition. Differences in the scalp distributions of these negativities were found to be a function of grammatical category rather than word class.

This review highlights recent neuroimaging findings in this controversy, assesses what they have contributed to this debate, and offers some preliminary conclusions. Namely, although neuroimaging studies have identified consistent neural correlates associated with basic emotions and other emotion models, they have ruled out simple one-to-one mappings between emotions and brain regions, pointing to the need for more complex, network-based representations of emotion.},

In contrast to the classical method (CM) of peak latency determination using only two or three electrodes, multichannel recordings deal with data from twenty or more recording electrodes. We compared the GFPM and CM in evoked potential recordings. Sixty five subjects volunteered for 3 different response tasks. In a P3 oddball paradigm targets consisted of 2000 Hz tonebursts, nontargets of 1000 Hz tonebursts. Flash and Pattern Visual Evoked Potentials (VEP) also were recorded. At peak GFPM latency we found steeper voltage gradients than at CM latency. Both N200 and P300 had a significantly different topography at latencies determined by GFPM than at latencies determined by CM. For VEP we did not find a significant difference between CM and GFPM. Our Data suggests that multichannel recording adds additional dimensions to EP measurements and that only GFPM leads to an unbiased data-reduction as it determinesone momentary map in time which has maximal field strength.},

Response time analyses showed a significant interaction between the frequency of the target and the frequency of those phonological neighbours that were higher in frequency than the target. Analysis of a published picture naming dataset gave similar results. The mechanisms underlying these results were explored using computational modelling. The critical interaction observed in the human data was successfully reproduced in analyses of the output of some versions of an interactive activation model. This model featured a relatively slow rise of activation in the phonological lexicon nodes, resulting in an increase in the effect of frequency. Overall, results show that phonological neighbourhood effects are tightly related to frequency effects.},

Consequently, we argue that his classificatory system\textemdash while useful for some descriptive purposes\textemdash is of very limited use as a theoretical framework for evolutionary linguistics. We see this incompatibility as related to the ontology of language, i.e. deriving from Hockett's interest in language as a product rather than a suite of sensorimotor, cognitive and social abilities that enable the use but also acquisition of language by biological creatures (the faculty of language). After a reconstruction of Hockett's views on design features, we raise two criticisms: focus on the means at the expense of content and focus on the code itself rather than the cognitive abilities of its users. Finally, referring to empirical data, we illustrate some of the problems resulting from Hockett's approach by addressing three specific points\textemdash namely arbitrariness and semanticity, cultural transmission, and displacement\textemdash and show how the change of perspective allows to overcome those difficulties.},

Memory was manipulated using differential distances (short distance (SD) and long distances with or without intermediate subject gaps (LD gap and LD no gap)) between the pronoun and the antecedent. Comparing incongruent to congruent conditions, person sentences with SD and LD no gap resulted in an N400-like effect indicating the involvement of semantic integration, whereas a P600 effect in LD gap (re-activated antecedents) sentences suggested the involvement of syntactic reanalysis. SD-thing sentences showed a P600 effect, whereas LD thing sentences revealed no effect at pronoun position. A delayed N400 effect for thing sentences was observed instead.

  abstract = {Word frequency and semantic priming effects are among the most robust effects in visual word recognition, and it has been generally assumed that these two variables produce interactive effects in lexical decision performance, with larger priming effects for low-frequency targets. The results from four lexical decision experiments indicate that the joint effects of semantic priming and word frequency are critically dependent upon differences in the vocabulary knowledge of the participants. Specifically, across two Universities, additive effects of the two variables were observed in means, and in RT distributional analyses, in participants with more vocabulary knowledge, while interactive effects were observed in participants with less vocabulary knowledge. These results are discussed with reference to [Borowsky, R., \&amp; Besner, D. (1993). Visual word recognition: A multistage activation model.

  abstract = {Competitive Scrabble is an activity that involves extraordinary word recognition experience. We investigated whether that experience is associated with exceptional behavior in the laboratory in a classic visual word recognition paradigm: the lexical decision task (LDT). We used a version of the LDT that involved horizontal and vertical presentation and a concreteness manipulation. In Experiment 1, we presented this task to a group of undergraduates, as these participants are the typical sample in word recognition studies. In Experiment 2, we compared the performance of a group of competitive Scrabble players with a group of age-matched nonexpert control participants. The results of a series of cognitive assessments showed that the Scrabble players and control participants differed only in Scrabble-specific skills (e.g., anagramming). Scrabble expertise was associated with two specific effects (as compared to controls): vertical fluency (relatively less difficulty judging lexicality for words presented in the vertical orientation) and semantic deemphasis (smaller concreteness effects for word responses). These results suggest that visual word recognition is shaped by experience, and that with experience there are efficiencies to be had even in the adult word recognition system.},

In contrast to previous models, the present model uses an architecture in which meanings are jointly determined by the 2 components, with the division of labor between them affected by the nature of the mappings between codes. The model is consistent with a variety of behavioral phenomena, including the results of studies of homophones and pseudohomophones thought to support other theories, and illustrates how efficient processing can be achieved using multiple simultaneous constraints.},

Compared with simple feedforward networks, representing phonological knowledge in an attractor network yielded improved learning and generalization. Phonological and surface forms of developmental dyslexia, which are usually attributed to impairments in distinct lexical and nonlexical processing "routes," were derived from different types of damage to the network.

  abstract = {Most neuroimaging studies examining verb morphology have focused on verb tense, with fewer examining agreement morphology, and no previous fMRI studies have investigated distinctions between past and present tense inflection. However, models of language representation and processing suggest differences in where these inflections are instantiated in the phrase structure as well as differences in the linguistic functions they serve, suggesting unique neural networks for these forms. In addition, results of available neuroimaging studies of grammatical morphology vary considerably due to methodological differences. Some studies have used overt production tasks, whereas others have used covert tasks. In the present study we examined brain activation associated with past tense and present tense/agreement morphology under overt and covert production conditions in 13 healthy adults using an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) design. Production of verbs inflected for past tense (V~+~-ed) and present tense/agreement (V~+~-s) was elicited using temporal adverbs (i.e. Yesterday, Nowadays). Results showed that in healthy adults inflecting both past tense and agreement morphology (compared to a verb stem production condition) recruited not only left inferior frontal structures, but also motor and premotor cortices, and posterior parietal regions. Activation also was observed in the basal ganglia, thalamus, and the cingulate gyrus. Past tense and present tense/agreement recruited partially overlapping tissue in these regions, with distinctions observed for the two forms in frontal and parietal brain areas. We also found that activation varied with task demands, with more extensive frontal activation noted in the overt compared to the covert verb inflection task. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the neural signatures for verb inflection differ from that for verb stems alone and involve a distributed frontal and parietal network of brain regions. Further, the neural tissue recruited for instantiation of past tense versus present tense/agreement morphology is distinct, supporting linguistic theories that differentiate the two forms.},

  abstract = {Extraordinary progress in functional brain imaging, primarily advances in functional magnetic resonance imaging, now allows scientists to understand the neural systems serving reading and how these systems differ in dyslexic readers. Scientists now speak of the neural signature of dyslexia, a singular achievement that for the first time has made what was previously a hidden disability, now visible. Paralleling this achievement in understanding the neurobiology of dyslexia, progress in the identification and treatment of dyslexia now offers the hope of identifying children at risk for dyslexia at a very young age and providing evidence-based, effective interventions. Despite these advances, for many dyslexic readers, becoming a skilled, automatic reader remains elusive, in great part because though children with dyslexia can be taught to decode words, teaching children to read fluently and automatically represents the next frontier in research on dyslexia. We suggest that to break through this "fluency" barrier, investigators will need to reexamine the more than 20-year-old central dogma in reading research: the generation of the phonological code from print is modular, that is, automatic and not attention demanding, and not requiring any other cognitive process. Recent findings now present a competing view: other cognitive processes are involved in reading, particularly attentional mechanisms, and that disruption of these attentional mechanisms play a causal role in reading difficulties. Recognition of the role of attentional mechanisms in reading now offer potentially new strategies for interventions in dyslexia. In particular, the use of pharmacotherapeutic agents affecting attentional mechanisms not only may provide a window into the neurochemical mechanisms underlying dyslexia but also may offer a potential adjunct treatment for teaching dyslexic readers to read fluently and automatically. Preliminary studies suggest that agents traditionally used to treat disorders of attention, particularly attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, may prove to be an effective adjunct to improving reading in dyslexic students.

However, nonarguments in similar sentences fail to elicit the same response. For example, the reflexive in John's brothers like himself is in an argument position and elicits the P600 when compared with its grammatical counterpart. The nonargument, participating in the same type of mismatch, John's brothers like Bill and himself , does not elicit the same positivity. This provides evidence that there are 2 processes involved in parsing this binding construction, one syntactic and another as yet unidentified, perhaps involving meaning or pragmatics.

The majority of 6-year-olds and a minority of 4-year-olds understood that the characters would be happy with the gift, given their mistaken belief about its contents. In Experiment 2, characters were given containers apparently containing an object they wanted but really containing an object they did not want, or vice versa. Predictions of emotion based on both the desire and the mistaken belief of the characters increased with age. In Experiment 3, characters were given closed containers that might or might not contain an item they wanted. Both 3-and 5-year-olds grasped that the characters' emotional reaction would depend on both their (unconfirmed) beliefs and desires about its content. The experiments show that preschool children deploy a theory-like conception of mind in predicting emotional reactions. They understand that the emotional impact of a situation depends not on its objective features but on the beliefs and desires that are brought to it.},

To derive a precise assessment of the prevalence of anxiety symptom and depressive symptom among college students worldwide, we conducted this meta-analysis. Methods Based on the guidance of PRISMA, literature was searched in Pubmed, Web of Science, Embase, and PsycArticles (last search November 6, 2020). These articles after the screening were analyzed by a random-effects model to estimate the pooled prevalence of anxiety symptom and depressive symptom. Also, subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis, and publication bias were performed in this meta-analysis. Results The results showed that the pooled anxiety symptom prevalence was 31\% (95\% CI: 23-39\%), pooled depressive symptom prevalence was 34\% (95\% CI: 27-41\%). Subgroup analysis showed that the prevalence of anxiety symptom and depressive symptom among different countries' college students were different, and the pooled depressive symptom prevalence of females was higher compared with males. Limitations The prevalence of anxiety symptom and depressive symptom in worldwide college students could be better assessed by a standard and reliable questionnaire. Conclusions The results suggest that the prevalence of anxiety symptom and depressive symptom during the COVID-19 pandemic is relatively high. Except for interventions that should be taken to control the pandemic urgently, mental health services are also needed to decrease the risk of anxiety and depression among college students.},

However, this previous investigation was unable to separate the putative word category effects from possible influences of the direction of acoustic change on the MMN response. The present study disentangled these two effects by comparing the effects of the direction of acoustic change within and isolated from the lexical context that had previously been used to create the word-category contrast. Although the direction of acoustic change exerted a significant influence on the MMN amplitude, some of the temporal and topographic characteristics of the MMN and the overall pattern of the deviance-related ERP response proved to be specific to word-category effects. These findings provide the first reliable evidence that the MMN can serve as an index of word-category-specific processing and support the notion of early processing and representational differences between verbs and nouns.},

Additionally, learning ability was affected by the nature of an S's processing deficit (whether it involved semantic and/or phonological processes). Phonological ability was positively associated with learning in both experiments, and semantic ability was associated with learning when words in a list were high in both frequency and imageability (Exp 1) or were contextually related to one another (Exp 2). Finally, verbal STM span was positively related to learning performance, but the effect was more pronounced for word span than digit span.

This served two goals, namely (I) to clarify their possible effects as confounds in ERP experiments employing word-stimuli, and (II) to determine the point in time of lexical access in visual word recognition. Methods: EEG was recorded from 64 scalp sites while subjects (n=12) performed a lexical decision task. Word length and frequency were orthogonally varied between stimulus groups, whereas variables including regularity of spelling and orthographic tri-gram frequency were kept constant. Results: Long words produced the strongest brain response early on ({$\sim$}100 ms after stimulus onset), whereas those to short words became strongest later (150\textendash 360 ms). Lower ERP amplitudes were elicited by words with high frequency compared with low frequency words in the latency ranges 150\textendash 190 ms and 320\textendash 360 ms. However, we did not find evidence for a robust alteration of peak latencies with word frequency. Conclusions: Length and frequency of word stimuli have independent and additive effects on the amplitude of the ERP. Studies on the precise time course of cognitive processes should consider their potentially confounding character. Our data support the view that lexical access takes place as early as 150 ms after onset of written word stimuli.},

  abstract = {We usually feel that we understand a familiar word "immediately". However, even basic aspects of the time-line of word recognition are still controversial. Different domains of research have still not converged on a coherent account. An integration of multiple sources of information would lead to more strongly constrained theoretical models, and help finding optimal measures when monitoring specific aspects of word recognition impairments in patient groups. In our multimodal approach--combining fast behavioral measures, ERPs and EEG/MEG source estimation--we provide converging evidence for the latencies of earliest lexical and semantic information retrieval in visual word recognition. Participants performed lexical and semantic decisions (LD, SD) in a Go/NoGo paradigm. We introduced eye-blink latencies as a dependent variable, in order to measure behavioral responses that are faster and less variable than traditional button presses. We found that the earliest behavioral responses distinguishing stimulus categories can occur around 310 ms. Ex-Gaussian analysis of behavioral responses did not reveal reliable differences between LD and SD. The earliest ERP differences between Go and NoGo conditions occurred around 160 ms for both LD and SD. Distributed source analysis of combined EEG/MEG data estimated neuronal generators for the lexicality effect around 200 ms in the left anterior middle temporal lobe. Thus, behavior and brain responses provide coherent evidence that the brain starts retrieving lexical and semantic information near-simultaneously within 200 ms of word onset. Our results support models of word recognition that assume a continuous accumulation of task-related information from the stimulus, which might be described by Bayesian principles.},

In the last 40 years, there has been an explosion of research on this problem as well as a sense that considerable progress has been made. We argue instead that the richness of ideas is accompanied by a poverty of evidence, with essentially no explanation of how and why our linguistic computations and representations evolved. We show that, to date, (1) studies of nonhuman animals provide virtually no relevant parallels to human linguistic communication, and none to the underlying biological capacity; (2) the fossil and archaeological evidence does not inform our understanding of the computations and representations of our earliest ancestors, leaving details of origins and selective pressure unresolved; (3) our understanding of the genetics of language is so impoverished that there is little hope of connecting genes to linguistic processes any time soon; (4) all modeling attempts have made unfounded assumptions, and have provided no empirical tests, thus leaving any insights into language's origins unverifiable. Based on the current state of evidence, we submit that the most fundamental questions about the origins and evolution of our linguistic capacity remain as mysterious as ever, with considerable uncertainty about the discovery of either relevant or conclusive evidence that can adjudicate among the many open hypotheses. We conclude by presenting some suggestions about possible paths forward.},

Two experiments were performed on derived nominals that differ in terms of their productivity and semantic properties but are otherwise similar, an acceptability judgment task and a reading experiment using event-related brain potentials (ERPs) in which correctly and incorrectly formed derived words were presented in sentence contexts. The first experiment indicated productivity differences between the different nominalization processes in Spanish. The second experiment yielded a pattern of ERP responses that differed from both the familiar lexical-semantic and grammatical ERP effects. Violations of derivational morphology elicited an increased N400 component plus a late positivity (P600), unlike gender-agreement violations, which produced the biphasic LAN/P600 ERP pattern known from previous studies of morpho-syntactic violations.

Using a word-picture associative learning task, we have previously shown that a brief exposure to novel words with embedded morphological structure (suffix for natural gender) is enough for language learners to acquire the hidden morphological rule. Here we used this paradigm to study the brain signatures of early morphological learning in a novel language in adults. Behavioural measures indicated successful lexical (word stem) and morphological (gender suffix) learning. A day after the learning phase, event-related brain potentials registered during a recognition memory task revealed enhanced N400 and P600 components for stem and suffix violations, respectively. An additional effect observed with combined suffix and stem violations was an enhancement of an early N2 component, most probably related to conflict-detection processes. Successful morphological learning was also evident in the ERP responses to the subsequent rule-generalization task with new stems, where violation of the morphological rule was associated with an early (250\textendash 400ms) and late positivity (750\textendash 900ms). Overall, these findings tend to converge with lexical and morphosyntactic violation effects observed in L1 processing, suggesting that even after a short exposure, adult language learners can acquire both novel words and novel morphological rules.},

The representation of invariant aspects of faces underlies the recognition of individuals, whereas the representation of changeable aspects of faces, such as eye gaze, expression, and lip movement, underlies the perception of information that facilitates social communication. The model is also hierarchical insofar as it is divided into a core system and an extended system. The core system is comprised of occipitotemporal regions in extrastriate visual cortex that mediate the visual analysis of faces. In the core system, the representation of invariant aspects is mediated more by the face-responsive region in the fusiform gyrus, whereas the representation of changeable aspects is mediated more by the face-responsive region in the superior temporal sulcus. The extended system is comprised of regions from neural systems for other cognitive functions that can be recruited to act in concert with the regions in the core system to extract meaning from faces.

Exp 1 (with 24 native Italian-speaking university students), using a cross-modal repetition priming task, showed that priming generated by regular inflected pairs does not differ from priming by irregular inflected pairs. Exp 2 (with 20 native speakers of Italian), using an elicitation task where Ss produce past-tense forms for novel verbs, not only showed little evidence for the presence of an underlying default but also demonstrated that phonological similarity can affect both regularized and irregularized elicitation patterns.

  abstract = {There is a long-standing debate about the principles and mechanisms that constrain the combinatorial properties of affixes, in particular of English suffixes. One group of scholars argues for the existence of lexical strata with strong restrictions holding between the different strata. This view is disputed by scholars who claim that it is selectional restrictions of individual suffixes that are responsible for the combinatorial properties of suffixes. Most recently, Hay (2000, 2002) has proposed a psycholinguistic model of morphological complexity, according to which an affix which can be easily parsed out in processing should not occur inside an affix which cannot. This model has been called ``complexity based ordering''. The general claim is that affixes can be approximately ordered along a hierarchy of complexity, with more separable affixes at one end, and less separable affixes at the other end. More separable affixes can attach outside less separable affixes, but not vice-versa. The goal of this paper is to test the predictions of complexity based ordering through an investigation of 15 English suffixes and their potential 210 two-suffix combinations. Using large data-bases such as the British National Corpus, the CELEX lexical database, the OED and the internet, we investigate whether the attested and non-attested combinations are best explained by complexity based ordering or by the individual selectional properties of these suffixes. We show that in most cases selectional restrictions and parsing restrictions coincide. Where selectional restrictions underdetermine possible combinations, complexity based ordering makes correct predictions. Only easily parsable combinations are possible combinations, and this range of possible combinations is then further curtailed by selectional restrictions. In sum, we argue that both selectional restrictions and parsing constraints are instrumental in determining possible and impossible suffix combinations.},

To illustrate the point, the ex-Gaussian model was applied to data obtained from a Stroop task. Mean RT revealed strong interference but no facilitation, whereas the analysis based on the ex-Gaussian model showed both interference and facilitation.

It begins by classifying different types of visual-spatial displays, followed by a discussion of ways in which visual-spatial displays augment cognition and an overview of the perceptual and cognitive processes involved in using displays. The paper then argues for the importance of cognitive science methods to the design of visual displays and reviews some of the main principles of display design that have emerged from these approaches to date. Cognitive scientists have had good success in characterizing the performance of well-defined tasks with relatively simple visual displays, but many challenges remain in understanding the use of complex displays for ill-defined tasks. Current research exemplified by the papers in this topic extends empirical approaches to new displays and domains, informs the development of general principles of graphic design, and addresses current challenges in display design raised by the recent explosion in availability of complex data sets and new technologies for visualizing and interacting with these data.},

In this study, we hypothesized that a source of this gap is greater reliance on information about others' behavior when deciding whether to take a risk oneself than when deciding whether to recommend it to others. To test this hypothesis, we asked participants either to report their willingness to engage in a series of risky behaviors themselves; their willingness to recommend those behaviors to a loved one; or, how good of an idea it would be for either them or a loved one to engage in the behaviors. We then asked them to evaluate those behaviors on criteria related to the expected utility of the risk (benefits, costs, and likelihood of costs), and on engagement in the activity by people they knew. We found that, after accounting for effects of perceived benefit, cost, and likelihood of cost, perceptions of others' behavior had a dramatically larger impact on participants' willingness to engage in a risk than on their willingness to recommend the risk or their prescriptive evaluation of the risk. These findings indicate that the influence of others' choices on risk-taking behavior is large, direct, cannot be explained by an economic utility model of risky decision-making, and goes against one's own better judgment.

For word frequency, oscillations in the theta range emerged. By contrast, phrase frequency showed a persistent effect over time. Furthermore, independent effects with different temporal and topographical signatures characterized phrasal prototypicality. In a simulation study we demonstrate that naive discrimination learning provides an alternative account of the data that is as least as powerful as a standard lexical predictor analysis.

  abstract = {I argue here that functional neuroimaging data\textemdash which I restrict to the haemodynamic techniques of fMRI and PET\textemdash can inform psychological theorizing, provided one assumes a ``systematic'' function\textendash structure mapping in the brain. In this case, imaging data simply comprise another dependent variable, along with behavioural data, that can be used to test competing theories. In particular, I distinguish two types of inference: function-to-structure deduction and structure-to-function induction. With the former inference, a qualitatively different pattern of activity over the brain under two experimental conditions implies at least one different function associated with changes in the independent variable. With the second type of inference, activity of the same brain region(s) under two conditions implies a common function, possibly not predicted a priori. I illustrate these inferences with imaging studies of recognition memory, short-term memory, and repetition priming. I then consider in greater detail what is meant by a ``systematic'' function\textendash structure mapping and argue that, particularly for structure-to-function induction, this entails a one-to-one mapping between functional and structural units, although the structural unit may be a network of interacting regions and care must be taken over the appropriate level of functional/structural abstraction. Nonetheless, the assumption of a systematic function\textendash structure mapping is a ``working hypothesis'' that, in common with other scientific fields, cannot be proved on independent grounds and is probably best evaluated by the success of the enterprise as a whole. I also consider statistical issues such as the definition of a qualitative difference and methodological issues such as the relationship between imaging and behavioural data. I finish by reviewing various objections to neuroimaging, including neophrenology, functionalism, and equipotentiality, and by observing some criticisms of current practice in the imaging literature.},

This notion, however, is wrong on both counts: neither does the glia/neuron ratio increase uniformly with brain size, nor do glial cells represent the majority of cells in the human brain. This review examines the origin of interest in the glia/neuron ratio; the original evidence that led to the notion that it increases with brain size; the extent to which this concept can be applied to white matter and whole brains and the recent supporting evidence that the glia/neuron ratio does not increase with brain size, but rather, and in surprisingly uniform fashion, with decreasing neuronal density due to increasing average neuronal cell size, across brain structures and species. Variations in the glia/neuron ratio are proposed to be related not to the supposed larger metabolic cost of larger neurons (given that this cost is not found to vary with neuronal density), but simply to the large variation in neuronal sizes across brain structures and species in the face of less overall variation in glial cell sizes, with interesting implications for brain physiology. The emerging evidence that the glia/neuron ratio varies uniformly across the different brain structures of mammalian species that diverged as early as 90 million years ago in evolution highlights how fundamental for brain function must be the interaction between glial cells and neurons.

Five experiments with 12-month-old human infants and adult cotton-top tamarin monkeys addressed these predictions, employing comparable methods (familiarization\textendash discrimination) and materials. Infants rapidly acquired complex grammatical structures by using statistically predictive patterns, failing to learn structures that lacked such patterns. In contrast, the tamarins only exploited predictive patterns when learning relatively simple grammatical structures. Infant learning abilities may serve both to facilitate natural language acquisition and to impose constraints on the structure of human languages.},

  abstract = {For many years, researchers investigating the brain bases of bilingualism have concentrated on two basic questions. The first concerns the nature of language representation. That is, are a bilinguals' two languages represented in distinct or overlapping areas of the brain. The second basic question in the neuropsychology of bilingualism concerns the neural correlates of language switching, that is, the areas that are active when bilinguals switch from one language to the other. Performance between single-language and dual-language picture naming was compared in a group of six Spanish\textendash English bilinguals using behavioral measures and functional magnetic resonance imaging. Participants showed slower reaction times and increased activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in the mixed language condition relative to single language condition. There was no evidence that each language was represented in different areas of the brain. Results are consistent with the view that language switching is a part of a general executive attentional system and that languages are represented in overlapping areas of the brain in early bilinguals.},

To settle this contradiction, we first examined the issue in the French language to see which interpretation generalized to a new language. Having found that the French data were similar to the Dutch data, we then reassessed the English evidence. On the basis of our findings, we conclude that the similarities among the languages are greater than the differences, and that the data are more in line with the Dutch pattern than with the previously reported English pattern.

  abstract = {The rapidity with which children acquire language is one of the mysteries of human cognition. A view held widely for the past 30 years is that children master language by means of a language-specific learning device. An earlier proposal, which has generated renewed interest, is that children make use of domain-general, associative learning mechanisms. However, our current lack of knowledge of the actual learning mechanisms involved during infancy makes it difficult to determine the relative contributions of innate and acquired knowledge. A recent approach to studying this problem exposes infants to artificial languages and assesses the resulting learning. In this article, we review studies using this paradigm that have led to a number of exciting discoveries regarding the learning mechanisms available during infancy. These studies raise important issues with respect to whether such mechanisms are general or specific to language, the extent to which they reflect statistical learning versus symbol manipulation, and the extent to which such mechanisms change with development. The fine-grained characterizations of infant learning mechanisms that this approach permits should result in a better understanding of the relative contributions of, and the dynamic between, innate and learned factors in language acquisition.},

Part of the difficulty, we suggest, stems from the fact that the neural systems supporting `speech perception' vary as a function of the task. Specifically, the set of cognitive and neural systems involved in performing traditional laboratory speech perception tasks, such as syllable discrimination or identification, only partially overlap those involved in speech perception as it occurs during natural language comprehension. In this review, we argue that cortical fields in the posterior\textendash superior temporal lobe, bilaterally, constitute the primary substrate for constructing sound-based representations of speech, and that these sound-based representations interface with different supramodal systems in a task-dependent manner. Tasks that require access to the mental lexicon (i.e. accessing meaning-based representations) rely on auditory-to-meaning interface systems in the cortex in the vicinity of the left temporal\textendash parietal\textendash occipital junction. Tasks that require explicit access to speech segments rely on auditory\textendash motor interface systems in the left frontal and parietal lobes. This auditory\textendash motor interface system also appears to be recruited in phonological working memory.},

Prenatal testosterone exposure also appears to influence sexual orientation and gender identity, as well as some, but not all, sex-related cognitive, motor and personality characteristics.

We then present evidence demonstrating that PBL and IL are powerful and effective models of learning. Far from being contrary to many of the principles of guided learning that Kirschner et al. discussed, both PBL and IL employ scaffolding extensively thereby reducing the cognitive load and allowing students to learn in complex domains. Moreover, these approaches to learning address important goals of education that include content knowledge, epistemic practices, and soft skills such as collaboration and self-directed learning.},

For later vision with scrutiny, reverse hierarchy routines focus attention to specific, active, low-level units, incorporating into conscious perception detailed information available there. Reverse Hierarchy Theory dissociates between early explicit perception and implicit low-level vision, explaining a variety of phenomena. Feature search ``pop-out'' is attributed to high areas, where large receptive fields underlie spread attention detecting categorical differences. Search for conjunctions or fine discriminations depends on reentry to low-level specific receptive fields using serial focused attention, consistent with recently reported primary visual cortex effects.},

We then examine to what extent lexical competition can account for anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activation and the N2/N400 complex. The subsequent section presents the Associative Read-Out Model (AROM), which extends the scope of IAMs by introducing explicit memory and semantic representations. Thereby, it can account for false memories, and familiarity and recollection \textendash{} explaining why memory signal variances are greater for studied than non-studied items. Since the AROM captures associative spreading across semantic long-term memory, it can also account for different temporal lobe functions, and allows for item-level predictions of the left inferior frontal gyrus' BOLD response. Finally, we use the AROM to examine whether semantic cohesiveness can account for effects previously ascribed to affective word features, i.e. emotional valence, and show that this is the case for positive, but not for negative valence.},

All the persons and things referred to in the corpora were labelled by the mothers using nouns. All the actions referred to were labelled using verbs. Most of the attributive information was conveyed by adjectives. Spatial information was expressed through the use of spatial prepositions. As to the functional categories, all agents of actions and causes of events were encoded as subjects of sentences. All patients, themes, sources, goals, locations, and instruments were encoded as objects of sentences (either direct or oblique). This good semantic-syntactic correspondence may make the child's construction of grammatical categories easier.},

Modern theories of retrieval in sentence comprehension do not indicate how this variation and the role of encoding processes should influence memory performance.

Three self-paced reading experiments provide evidence that reading times at retrieval sites (but not earlier) decrease when more complex phrases occur as filler phrases in filler-gap dependencies. The data also show that complexity-based effects are not dependent on string length, syntactic differences, or the amount of processing the stimuli elicit. Activation boosting and reduced similarity-based interference are implicated as likely sources of these complexity-based effects. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

The framework specifies how this pattern is invoked via an activation gradient that interacts with subthreshold oscillations and how it is decoded via contextual units that activate word units. Using mathematical modeling, this theoretical framework is shown to account for the experimental data from a wide variety of string-processing studies, including hemispheric asymmetries, the optimal viewing position, and positional priming effects.},

  abstract = {Derivational morphology is a cross-linguistically dominant mechanism for word formation, combining existing words with derivational affixes to create new word forms. However, the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying the representation and processing of such forms remain unclear. Recent cross-linguistic neuroimaging research suggests that derived words are stored and accessed as whole forms, without engaging the left-hemisphere perisylvian network associated with combinatorial processing of syntactically and inflectionally complex forms. Using fMRI with a 'simple listening' no-task procedure, we reexamine these suggestions in the context of the root-based combinatorially rich Italian lexicon to clarify the role of semantic transparency (between the derived form and its stem) and affix productivity in determining whether derived forms are decompositionally represented and which neural systems are involved. Combined univariate and multivariate analyses reveal a key role for semantic transparency, modulated by affix productivity. Opaque forms show strong cohort competition effects, especially for words with nonproductive suffixes (ventura, 'destiny'). The bilateral frontotemporal activity associated with these effects indicates that opaque derived words are processed as whole forms in the bihemispheric language system. Semantically transparent words with productive affixes (libreria, 'bookshop') showed no effects of lexical competition, suggesting morphologically structured co-representation of these derived forms and their stems, whereas transparent forms with nonproductive affixes (pineta, pine forest) show intermediate effects. Further multivariate analyses of the transparent derived forms revealed affix productivity effects selectively involving left inferior frontal regions, suggesting that the combinatorial and decompositional processes triggered by such forms can vary significantly across languages.

  abstract = {Purpose Developmental dyslexia (DD) is commonly thought to arise from phonological impairments. However, an emerging perspective is that a more general procedural learning deficit, not specific to phonological processing, may underlie DD. The current study examined if individuals with DD are capable of extracting statistical regularities across sequences of passively experienced speech and nonspeech sounds. Such statistical learning is believed to be domain-general, to draw upon procedural learning systems, and to relate to language outcomes. Method DD and control groups were familiarized with a continuous stream of syllables or sine-wave tones, the ordering of which was defined by high or low transitional probabilities across adjacent stimulus pairs. Participants subsequently judged two 3-stimulus test items with either high or low statistical coherence as being the most similar to the sounds heard during familiarization. Results As with control participants, the DD group was sensitive to the transitional probability structure of the familiarization materials as evidenced by above-chance performance. However, the performance of participants with DD was significantly poorer than controls across linguistic and nonlinguistic stimuli. In addition, reading-related measures were significantly correlated with statistical learning performance of both speech and nonspeech material. Conclusion Results are discussed in light of procedural learning impairments among participants with DD.},

  abstract = {The visual aesthetics of an object increases visual attention towards the object. It is argued that this relation between liking and attention is an evolutionary adaptation in sexual and natural selection. If this is the case, we would expect this relation to be domain specific, and thus, stronger for biological than for non-biological objects. To test this hypothesis, we conducted two eye-tracking studies, in which we compared the relation between liking and gaze patterns in images of biological (faces) and non-biological (paintings) stimuli. In Study 1, we presented randomly combined image pairs for 20 s in a free-viewing paradigm. Participants then selected the image they liked more in a 2-AFC task and rated the liking of each image on a Likert-scale. In Study 2, we employed the same paradigm but this time, images were combined based on pre-rated liking to ensure that images in each pair were clearly different. In both studies, we found a strong relation between liking and visual attention. Against our expectations, these effects were of similar magnitude for faces as for paintings. We conclude that the relation between liking and visual attention is not limited to biological objects but that its effects are domain general. The evolutionary function of the relation between liking and visual attention might stem from evolutionary adaptations, nonetheless, this link seems to be a rather basic phenomenon that applies across domains.

  abstract = {Lexical decision experiments in Spanish with 24 undergraduates addressed the processing and representation of morphologically complex words in the mental lexicon. Responses to targets (e.g., mor-os "Moors") were found to be reliably slower and less accurate when they were preceded by stem homograph primes (mor-ir "to die") compared to unrelated control primes (sill-a "chair"), and this inhibitory effect was over and above the marginal reaction time effect for morphologically unrelated primes that shared just as much left-to-right orthographic overlap with the target stem as the stem homograph primes. This may be evidence that the stem homograph effect is a direct consequence of morphological decomposition in lexical access. In exp 2, an inhibitory effect was observed when the same targets were preceded by primes that were not themselves stem homographic with the target, but rather allomorphically related to stems that were stem homographs (muer-e "she/he/it dies"). Since target inhibition was found for primes whose inflectional stems are not strictly ambiguous at the level of form, this pattern of results provides evidence for morphologically abstract (lemma-like) representations that are engaged in lexical access at a form-neutral level of morpholexical processing.

Moreover, there was only a modest decline in the size of N400 repetition priming at the shortest prime durations, and there was no relationship between this N400 effect and a measure of prime categorization performance. However, the size of semantic priming at the shortest durations was relatively smaller than at longer durations and was correlated with prime categorization performance.

Such metaphors likening cognitive processes to visual experience suggest a close correspondence between how we think about and how we see the world. Accordingly, major theoretical advances in the sciences have been frequently accompanied by the development of novel visualization tools and graphical conventions (e.g., the periodic table). Today, knowing how to make a graph is a critical component of any practicing scientist's repertoire, allowing her to gain insight when exploring a complex data set, and to communicate empirical findings to other scientists and the public. This paper reviews evidence from the cognitive science and educational research literatures that bears on the question of how drawing, the most basic visualization technique, interacts with cognitive functions that are core to scientific thinking, including: observation, problem-solving, explanation, and communication. Expanding the role of graphical literacy in science education may carry the potential to better reveal to students the dynamic and inquiry-based nature of scientific thinking, especially in contexts where visual representations have traditionally been subordinate to linguistic and numerical representations.

The results showed that reading Chinese passive relative primes reduced processing difficulty in English targets at the dispreferred disambiguation. Chinese-to-English priming in comprehension occurred without lexical and word-order equivalence between primes and targets. In addition, translation-equivalent verbs did not boost cross-linguistic structural priming. The findings support an account under which bilingual sentence processing involves abstract, unordered syntactic representations that are integrated between languages.

Prior research has shown that the function relating ease of word recognition and initial fixation position in the word is not symmetric. Word recognition is generally superior when the initial fixation is left rather than right of the center of the word. This asymmetry in the function relating initial fixation position to word identifiability could be due to (a) hemispheric specialization, (b) reading habits, or (c) variations in lexical constraint. The present experiments tested these alternative explanations by comparing the effects of initial fixation position in prefixed and suffixed words in French and Arabic. The results show that, contrary to both the hemispheric specialization and reading habit hypotheses, the average initial fixation curves for Arabic are asymmetric neither to the left nor to the right but depend on the morphological structure of the stimuli, thus lending support to the lexical constraint hypothesis.},

Theories of morphology, particularly connectionist and symbolic models, disagree on which nonphonological factors are responsible. We test four possibilities: (1) Lexical effects, in which two lemmas differ in whether they specify an irregular form; (2) Semantic effects, in which the semantic features of a word become associated with regular or irregular forms; (3) Morphological structure effects, in which a word with a headless structure (e.g., a verb derived from a noun) blocks access to a stored irregular form; (4) Compositionality effects, in which the stored combination of an irregular word's meaning (e.g., the verb's inherent aspect) with the meaning of the inflection (e.g., pastness) doesn't readily transfer to new senses with different combinations of such meanings. In four experiments, speakers were presented with existing and novel verbs and asked to rate their past-tense forms, semantic similarities, grammatical structure, and aspectual similarities. We found (1) an interaction between semantic and phonological similarity, coinciding with reported strategies of analogizing to known verbs and implicating lexical effects; (2) weak and inconsistent effects of semantic similarity; (3) robust effects of morphological structure, and (4) robust effects of aspectual compositionality. Results are consistent with theories of language that invoke lexical entries and morphological structure, and which differentiate the mode of storage of regular and irregular verbs. They also suggest how psycholinguistic processes have shaped vocabulary structure over history.},

We show that change blindness for a conversation partner occurs in a variety of situations. Furthermore, when tested with a photographic lineup following the change, participants who noticed the substitution showed better memory for both pre-and post-change experimenters than participants who did not detect the change. We conclude that change blindness in this case is associated with relatively ineffective or inaccessible representations of previously attended objects, and we contrast these results with others indicating that change blindness arises from a failure to compare the original and changed object.},

On the dual-route account, inflectional morphology is universally subserved by a symbolic rule route which deals with regular inflection and an associative memory component which deals with irregular inflection. This contrasts with single-route connectionist systems. The authors of the present article seek to counter supposed evidence for the dual-route account through large-scale simulations as well as through experimental data. The authors argue that, in its current form, the dual-route account is incapable of generating experimental data provided by Marcus et al. as support. Finally, the authors provide direct quantitative comparisons between single-route and dual-route models of German plural inflection and find single-route performance superior on these tests.

  abstract = {This article explores how bilinguals perform automatic morphological decomposition processes, focusing on within- and cross-language masked morphological priming effects. In Experiment 1, unbalanced Spanish (L1)\textendash English (L2) bilingual participants completed a lexical decision task on English targets that could be preceded by morphologically related or unrelated derived masked English and Spanish prime words. The cognate status of the masked Spanish primes was manipulated, in order to explore to what extent form overlap mediates cross-language morphological priming. In Experiment 2, a group of balanced native Basque\textendash Spanish speakers completed a lexical decision task on Spanish targets preceded by morphologically related or unrelated Basque or Spanish masked primes. In this experiment, a large number of items were tested and the cognate status was manipulated according to a continuous measure of orthographic overlap, allowing for a fine-grained analysis of the role of form overlap in cross-language morphological priming. Results demonstrated the existence of between-language masked morphological priming, which was exclusively found for cognate prime-target pairs. Furthermore, the results from balanced and unbalanced bilinguals were highly similar showing that proficiency in the two languages at test does not seem to modulate the pattern of data. These results are correctly accounted for by mechanisms of early morpho-orthographic decomposition that do not necessarily imply an automatic translation of the prime. In contrast, other competing accounts that are based on translation processes do not seem to capture the present results.},

Participants were presented with words (in Experiments 1 and 3) and nonwords (in Experiment 2) that contained a buried word whose letters differed in color relative to the other letters present (e.g.,pig, in spring). The strings were presented in single case or mixed case, keeping the letters of the buried words in one case (SpRiNg). The time in which the whole stimulus was named was shorter for same-case than for mixed-case strings (forspring: spring {$<$} SpRiNg). In contrast, the time in which buried words were named was shorter in mixed- than in same-case strings (forpig: spring {$>$} SpRiNg). Across items, the effects of case mixing were negatively correlated across the two tasks. The positive effect of case mixing for buried words also occurred irrespective of whether the whole string was a word or a nonword, and there were contributions from similarity of both letter size and case. The results suggest that case mixing can facilitate selective attention to letters, which is otherwise disrupted by size- and case-based grouping across letter strings. The study provides evidence for letter grouping using size and case information.},

This longitudinal study (n = 27) explores whether Spanish-learning children's early experiences with language predict efficiency in real-time comprehension and vocabulary learning. Measures of mothers' speech at 18 months were examined in relation to children's speech processing efficiency and reported vocabulary at 18 and 24 months. Children of mothers who provided more input at 18 months knew more words and were faster in word recognition at 24 months. Moreover, multiple regression analyses indicated that the influences of caregiver speech on speed of word recognition and vocabulary were largely overlapping. This study provides the first evidence that input shapes children's lexical processing efficiency and that vocabulary growth and increasing facility in spoken word comprehension work together to support the uptake of the information that rich input affords the young language learner.},

If this were so, then they would be unable to impute beliefs to others and to predict their behaviour. This hypothesis was tested using Wimmer and Perner's puppet play paradigm. Normal children and those with Down's syndrome were used as controls for a group of autistic children. Even though the mental age of the autistic children was higher than that of the controls, they alone failed to impute beliefs to others. Thus the dysfunction we have postulated and demonstrated is independent of mental retardation and specific to autism.},

In Experiments 2 and 3, the same words were embedded in sentence contexts, where both the inflected and non-inflected forms were equally plausible, and eye fixation patterns (Experiment 2; n=24) and lexical decision latencies (Experiment 3; n=21) were recorded. The experiment with isolated words replicated previous lexical decision studies by showing more effortful processing for inflected than monomorphemic nouns. However, this morphological complexity effect did not generalise to the context experiments; fixation durations and response latencies were highly similar for inflected and monomorphemic words. It is suggested that, at least for the type of inflected nouns studied, the morphological effect observed for isolated words may derive from the syntactic and/or semantic level and not necessarily from the lexical level, as previously assumed.

A standard model maintains that Arabic words are typically analyzable into a three-consonantal root morpheme carrying the core meaning of words and a prosodic template responsible mostly for grammatical information. This view has been largely supported by research in both theoretical linguistics and psycholinguistics. An alternative theory holds that the meaning of words in Arabic is, rather, encoded in the 'etymon' comprising two unordered consonants of the root only. Results from a recent priming experiment have shown that the etymon induces strong morphological priming effects, supporting its morphological/ lexical status. In this paper we present data from a patient with deep dyslexia questioning the role of the etymon as a psychologically real representational unit in Arabic and arguing, instead, for the central role of the root in both morphological and lexical representation in this language.

Methods: Subjects (n=32) were instructed to respond to the display color of a word but to ignore its meaning. Display color was congruent, neutral, or incongruent with word meaning. Results: Stroop facilitation and interference effects were observed, as RT was shortest in the congruent condition, intermediate in the neutral condition, and longest in the incongruent condition. In contrast, P300 latency did not vary across color/word congruence conditions, suggesting that the RT difference between congruence conditions originated after stimulus evaluation. Conclusions: These manual RT/P300 findings support the view that Stroop interference and facilitation originate from response competition between the relevant and irrelevant stimulus attributes. By employing an arbitrary mapping of color words onto buttons, the present results indicate that the disparate effects of Stroop stimuli on RT and P300 latency do not depend on the nature of the S-R translation.},

With lexical decision and naming tasks, repetition priming and contiguous priming procedures, and masked and unmasked prime presentation, a pattern of results emerged with qualitative differences between the effects of morphological and form relatedness. With lexical decision, mere orthographic similarity between primes and targets (e.g., keller-KELLE, cellar-ladle) produced negative effects, whereas morphological relatedness (e.g., kellen-KELLE, ladles-ladle) consistently resulted in facilitation. With the naming task, positive priming effects were found for morphological as well as for mere form similarity. On the basis of these results, a model of the lexicon is proposed in which information about word form is represented separately from morphological structure and in which processing at the form level is characterized in terms of activation of, and competition between, form-related entries.

Two main factors were manipulated: (1) The degree of complexity of the morphosyntactic violation, (2) The moment when the agreement violation occurs within the sentence. Both types of morphological agreement violations (intra/inter) elicited a biphasic anterior negativity/P600 ERP pattern. However, the amplitude of this pattern was larger for the interphrasal violation than for the intraphrasal one. This result suggests an easier detection but a more costly integration when the agreement violation occurs between elements belonging to different syntactic units. Moreover, an effect of position was observed but only when the violation concerned elements of a single syntactic unit. Taken together, the present findings suggest that morphological integration may be modulated by both the complexity of morphosyntactic agreement and the moment at which it takes place during the course of sentence processing.

A total of 72 university students participated. In the first experiment, it took longer to recognize that a syllable was the beginning of a word than to make the same judgment of a BOSS. The fact that a BOSS plus one letter also took longer to judge than the BOSS indicated that the maximal coda principle applies to the units of processing in French. The second experiment confirmed this, using a lexical decision task with the different units being demarcated on the basis of color.

The precise timing of when the brain computes neural representations that are invariant to particular transformations, however, has not been mapped in humans. Here we employ magnetoencephalography decoding analysis to measure the dynamics of size- and position-invariant visual information development in the ventral visual stream. With this method we can read out the identity of objects beginning as early as 60 ms. Size- and position-invariant visual information appear around 125 ms and 150 ms, respectively, and both develop in stages, with invariance to smaller transformations arising before invariance to larger transformations. Additionally, the magnetoencephalography sensor activity localizes to neural sources that are in the most posterior occipital regions at the early decoding times and then move temporally as invariant information develops. These results provide previously unknown latencies for key stages of human-invariant object recognition, as well as new and compelling evidence for a feed-forward hierarchical model of invariant object recognition where invariance increases at each successive visual area along the ventral stream.},

In print, dots that represent vowels in Hebrew script are almost always omitted, and because a single consonant string may represent several different words (with different vowels), the reader can assign to it a unique meaning and pronunciation only in relation to the syntactic and semantic contexts. Two experiments involving a total of 32 undergraduates manipulated phonemic ambiguity by comparing consonant strings that have only a single meaningful pronunciation with strings that are several meaningful pronunciations. Although naming was slower when several pronunciations were possible, these phonemically ambiguous strings were not recognized more slowly in a lexical-decision task. A 3rd study, in which lexical decisions were made by 16 undergraduates for consonant strings presented with the vowel dots, showed that nonword homographs were rejected more slowly than were nonword homophones. These results suggest that in Hebrew, orthographic codes play a more important role in the process of word recognition than do phonemic codes, especially in comparison with the roles played in other languages.

A clear, comprehensive review of the origin and measurement of EEG that bridges these high and low levels of explanation fills a critical gap in the literature and is necessary for promoting better research practices and peer review.

Singular they has a long history of use, but continues to draw criticism from prescriptivist commentators. Recent research has found that those who endorse more binary gender ideology tend to reject singular they more often than those who hold more egalitarian gender views. The present study directly compared the contributions of linguistic prescriptivism and sexism to speakers' judgments in order to determine whether resistance to singular they is driven more by strict adherence to standard grammar or instead by attitudes about gender which are at odds with the language itself. American English speakers rated the grammaticality of sentences containing singular they and also responded to measures of linguistic prescriptivism and hostile and benevolent sexism. Results indicate that resistance to gender-neutral language is driven by sexist (but not necessarily hostile) attitudes about gender as much as by linguistic conservatism, though both contribute to grammatical judgments. Such resistance is particularly hostile to innovations that challenge the gender binary. These results carry implications for both theories of pronoun reference and language reform initiatives.},

Reaction time facilitation is obtained for letters in the nominally identical condition if the different condition serves as baseline, but not if a within-condition baseline is used. Words are classified more rapidly as words when preceded by a physically or nominally identical stimulus. Results demonstrate that target processing in speeded letter and word classification depends on prime type and prime intensity, and it is argued that standard interpretation of priming effects is better constrained by the double baseline approach of this technique.

The latter observation cannot be explained under the dual mechanism approach, which derives all regulars with a single rule. To evaluate the alternative hypothesis that all morphology is analogical, we implemented a purely analogical model, which evaluates novel pasts based solely on their similarity to existing verbs. Tested against experimental data, this analogical model also failed in key respects: it could not locate patterns that require abstract structural characterizations, and it favored implausible responses based on single, highly similar exemplars. We conclude that speakers extend morphological patterns based on abstract structural properties, of a kind appropriately described with rules.

  abstract = {During comprehension, a personal pronoun (he, she, it) refers to a preceding referent (boy, girl, child). This co-reference could be established, among other ways, by using (i) conceptual/semantic information (biological gender agreement between the pronoun and its referent), (ii) syntactic information (syntactic gender agreement), or (iii) both. This event-related brain potential (ERP) study assesses this interplay of syntactic and semantic information. We focussed on the N400 component, related to semantic integration, and the SPS/P600 component, related to syntactic reanalysis. The study was conducted in German, because its rich syntactic gender system offers a means to dissociate between biological (MALE/FEMALE) and syntactic gender (masculine/feminine/neuter), especially in the case of diminutives (dasneuter B\"ubchenMALE [the little boy]). German subjects read sentences in which a referent (B\"ubchenMALE-neuter/BubMALE-masculine [boy]) was introduced. Later a personal pronoun was presented which either agreed with the referent in terms of syntactic gender, or in terms of biological gender, or both, or violated both agreements. Overall, results showed salient P600 effects for pronouns. This indicates that the establishment of reference involves syntactic reanalysis. Furthermore, we observed N400 effects in sentences with non-diminutives, but not with diminutives. This shows that conceptual/semantic integration is involved during non-diminutive but not during diminutive pronoun processing, or at least it could not be violated. The overall pattern of results supports the claim that for non-diminutives, both syntactic and conceptual information is used to establish co-reference, while for diminutives the process might be purely syntactically driven.},

The lexical representations of these morphemic units were examined using masked priming. When primes and targets shared an identical word pattern, neither lexical decision nor naming of targets was facilitated. In contrast, root primes facilitated both lexical decisions and naming of target words that were derived from these roots. This priming effect proved to be independent of meaning similarity because no priming effects were found when primes and targets were semantically but not morphologically related. These results suggest that Hebrew roots are lexical units whereas word patterns are not. A working model of lexical organization in Hebrew is offered on the basis of these results.

However, the reasons for this correlation are unclear, and questions remain regarding which aspects of language are related to which aspects of ToM, when, and perhaps most important, why. In this chapter, the authors argue that one aspect of language (labeling) is related to standard preschool measures of ToM (e.g., false-belief, representational-change, and appearance-reality tasks) because these measures of ToM all require cognitive flexibility, which undergoes dramatic changes during the preschool years. In support of this argument, the authors briefly review the results of recent experimental research on the effects of labeling on tasks that assess cognitive flexibility. The results of these studies indicate that there are widespread changes in the effects of labeling on 4-year-olds' performance on these tasks. The chapter concludes with predictions for future experimental labeling manipulations with ToM tasks that might shed light on the causal nature of the relation between language and ToM.

  abstract = {Extracting meaning from speech requires the use of pragmatic, semantic, and syntactic information. A central question is: Does the processing of these different types of linguistic information have common or distinct neuroanatomical substrates? We addressed this issue using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure neural activity when subjects listened to spoken normal sentences contrasted with sentences that had either (A) pragmatical, (B) semantic (selection restriction), or (C) syntactic (subcategorical) violations sentences. All three contrasts revealed robust activation of the left-inferior-temporal/fusiform gyrus. Activity in this area was also observed in a combined analysis of all three experiments, suggesting that it was modulated by all three types of linguistic violation. Planned statistical comparisons between the three experiments revealed (1) a greater difference between conditions in activation of the left-superior-temporal gyrus for the pragmatic experiment than the semantic/syntactic experiments; (2) a greater difference between conditions in activation of the right-superior and middletemporal gyrus in the semantic experiment than in the syntactic experiment; and (3) no regions activated to a greater degree in the syntactic experiment than in the semantic experiment. These data show that, while left- and right-superior-temporal regions may be differentially involved in processing pragmatic and lexico-semantic information within sentences, the left-inferior-temporal/fusiform gyrus is involved in processing all three types of linguistic information. We suggest that this region may play a key role in using pragmatic, semantic (selection restriction), and subcategorical information to construct a higher representation of meaning of sentences.},

Our main objective was to ascertain whether morphosyntactic category violations would differ from violations of prosodic constraints. For each type of incorrect suffixation, the data yielded an N400-like effect, but the processing of incorrectly derived words varies according to the type of violation: Effects for -ung- and -heit violations appeared approximately 200 ms earlier than for -keit-violations. Furthermore, the negativity effect for -ung was stronger and distributed over the whole scalp, whereas the effect for -heit and -keit is restricted to parietal electrodes. We interpret the differences as suggesting that different word formation restrictions play different roles in the processing of derived words, such that morphosyntactic restrictions are more salient than prosodic ones.},

  abstract = {Is morphology a discrete and independent element of lexical structure or does it simply reflect a fine tuning of the system to the statistical correlation that exists among the orthographic and semantic properties of words? Imaging studies in English failed to show unequivocal morphological activation that is distinct from semantic or orthographic activation. Cognitive research in Hebrew has revealed that morphological decomposition is an important component of print processing. In Hebrew, morphological relatedness does not necessarily induce a clear semantic relatedness, thus, Hebrew provides a unique opportunity to investigate the neural substrates of morphological processing. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study, participants were required to perform judgment tasks of morphological relatedness, semantic relatedness, rhyming, and orthographic similarity. Half of the morphologically related words were semantically related and half were semantically unrelated. This design was chosen to induce explicit morphological processing. We identified two locations involved in morphological processing: the left middle frontal gyrus and the left inferior parietal sulcus. Comparing locations of morphological related activation to the locations of semantic and orthographic related activation, we found that the areas neighbored but only partially overlapped. The similarity in activation between the two morphological conditions eliminates the possibility that morphological activation simply results from the semantic properties of the words. These results demonstrate the important role of morphological processing in reading and suggest that morphological analysis is a distinct process of visual word recognition.

As body image disturbance is one of the main diagnostic criteria in anorexia nervosa (AN) this study aimed at looking for alterations in gray matter density in women with (AN) especially in the EBA. High resolution T1 images from 15 women with AN and 15 age matched healthy controls women were contrasted using voxel based morphometry (VBM). Additionally functional localizer scans were used to determine functionally the EBA of each participant. In general, total gray matter volumes did differ between groups. VBM results yielded evidence for a reduction of gray matter density in the left EBA. This reduction, which resulted from whole brain analysis, was localised within the activation cluster of the EBA localizer scan. The current results provide for the first time evidence for structural alterations in the EBA in patients with AN which might suggest that body image distortion is related at least in part to structural alteration in the EBA.},

  abstract = {In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content: THE PSYCHOLOGICAL REALITY OF PHONAESTHEMES BENJAMIN K. BERGEN University of Hawai'i at Manoa The psychological reality of English phonaesthemes is demonstrated through a priming experiment with native speakers of American English. Phonaesthemes are well-represented soundmeaning pairings, such as English gl-, which occurs in numerous words with meanings relating to light and vision. In the experiment, phonaesthemes, despite being noncompositional in nature, displayed priming effects much like those that have been reported for compositional morphemes. These effects could not be explained as the result of semantic or phonological priming, either alone or in combination. The results support a view of the lexicon in which shared form and meaning across words is a key factor in their relatedness, and in which morphological composition is not required for internal word structure to play a role in language processing.* 1. INTRODUCTION. Phonaesthemes (Firth 1930) are frequently recurring soundmeaning pairings that are not clearly contrastive morphemes. An example is the English onsetgl- (Wallis 1699, Bloomfield 1933), which, like otherphonaesthemes, is relatively infrequent in English, except among words with meanings related to `vision' and `light'. Some of these are exemplified in 1a. Another well-documented phonaestheme (Wallis 1699, Bloomfield 1933) is the English onset sn-, which occurs in a large number of words relating to `mouth' and `nose' (1b). (1) a. gl- `light, vision' glimmer, glisten, glitter, gleam, glow, glint, etc. b. sn- `nose, mouth' snore, snack, snout, snarl, snort, sniff, sneeze, etc. When viewed simply as statistically aberrant distributions of sound-meaning pairings in the lexicon, phonaesthemes are found to be pervasive in human languages. They have been documented in such diverse languages as English (Wallis 1699, Firth 1930, Marchand 1959, Bolinger 1949, 1980), Indonesian (McCune 1983) and other Austronesian languages (Blust 1988), Japanese (Hamano 1998), Ojibwa (Rhodes 1981), and Swedish (Abelin 1999). While it is difficult to establish reliable estimates of how many of the world's languages contain phonaesthemes, or how many words in a given language's lexicon have phonaesthemes in them, every systematic study of a particular language has produced results suggesting that that language has phonaesthemes. In general, phonaesthemes seem to appear in content words over function words, and in more specific (or subordinate level) rather than more general (or basic level) words. In addition to distributional evidence, phonaesthemes can be detected through their role in language change, in particular by the part they play in the generation of neologisms (Joseph 1987). Phonaesthemes have been implicated in both the production and perception of neologisms on the basis of experimental (Abelin 1999) and comparative studies (Blust 1988, 2003). The recurrent finding of note in this latter area is that in a given set of related languages, phonaesthemes that appear in some languages will also appearin otherlanguages but in words that are not cognates. Forexample, the Austronesian phonaestheme {$\surd$} occurs in initial position in words that have meanings related to `nose' or `mouth' (Blust 2003). In particular, it appears in words meaning `chew, masticate, ruminate', such as Amis {$\surd$}af{$\surd$}af, Toba Batak {$\surd$}altok, and Trukese {$\surd$}u\textasciiacute, among others, but none of these words are cognates. * Thanks to Nancy Chang, Jerome Feldman, Larry Hyman, Sharon Inkelas, George Lakoff, and Madelaine Plauche\textasciiacute{} for helpful comments on drafts of related work, and to Amy Schafer and Robert Blust, in addition to two anonymous referees, for very useful suggestions on this paper. 290 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL REALITY OF PHONAESTHEMES 291 While statistically significant representation in the lexicon and participation in the construction of neologisms are important convergent indications that phonaesthemes are a viable part of language, these two types of evidence leave room for different interpretations of what exactly the status is of phonaesthemes. The extent to which phonaesthemes play a role in the synchronic mental organization of language remains an open question. Indeed, their cognitive status remains controversial in part because they do not fit well into linguistic theories that view compositionality as a defining characteristic of morphological complexity, such as so-called ITEM-AND-ARRANGEMENT models (Hockett 1954). On these compositional types of account, phonaesthemes belong outside the scope of regular morphological analysis. By contrast, noncompositional theories of morphology predict that recurrent sound-meaning pairings in a language, whether compositional or not, will rise...},

In all experiments compounds were primed by initial morphemes with and without the interfix. In Greek and Polish priming was significantly facilitated in cases where the mophological prime was homophonous with a real word. In German, however, the effect of wordness was found for un-interfixed but not for interfixed primes.

Recently J\"arvikivi and Niemi (in press) have provided converging evidence for their claim based on a series of lexical decision experiments with Finnish stem allomorphs. The results from the present series of four follow-up experiments reported here showed that (isolated) bound stem allomorphs primed the recognition of the corresponding monomorphemic nouns significantly compared both to phonologically unrelated pseudowords and to phonologically minimally different pseudowords. Furthermore, not only did both phonologically transparent and opaque case inflected nouns prime the corresponding nominative singulars, but also there was no difference in priming between the two. The results are well in accordance and corroborate the hypotheses drawn from the earlier investigations. Moreover, they further indicate that bound stem allomorphs have representations on a purely formal level only, i.e., they serve as indices of and entering points to morphological/morphosyntactic information.},

  abstract = {Visual attention studies often rely on response time measures to show the impact of attentional facilitation and inhibition. Here we extend the investigation of the effects of attention on behavior and show that prior attentional states associated with unfamiliar faces can influence subsequent social-emotional judgments about those faces. Participants were shown pairs of face images and were asked to withhold a response if a transparent stop-signal cue appeared over one of the faces. This served to associate the cued face with an inhibitory state. Later, when asked to make social-emotional choices about these face pairs, participants chose uncued faces more often than cued faces as ``more trustworthy'' and chose cued faces more often than uncued faces as ``less trustworthy.'' For perceptual choices, there was no effect of how the question was framed (which face is ``on a lighter background'' vs. ``on a darker background''). These results suggest that attentional inhibition can be associated with socially relevant stimuli, such as faces, and can have specific, deleterious effects on social-emotional judgments.},

  abstract = {Within the last 10 years, there has been an upsurge of interest in face processing abilities in autism which has generated a proliferation of new empirical demonstrations employing a variety of measuring techniques. Observably atypical social behaviors early in the development of children with autism have led to the contention that autism is a condition where the processing of social information, particularly faces, is impaired. While several empirical sources of evidence lend support to this hypothesis, others suggest that there are conditions under which autistic individuals do not differ from typically developing persons. The present paper reviews this bulk of empirical evidence, and concludes that the versatility and abilities of face processing in persons with autism have been underestimated.

Brain-injured patients differ with respect to whether they are more impaired in generating irregular past tenses (take\textendash took) or past tenses for nonce verbs (wug\textendash wugged). Such dissociations have been taken as evidence for distinct ``rule'' and ``associative'' memory systems in morphology and against the connectionist approach in which a single system is used for all forms. We describe a simulation model in which these impairments arise from damage to phonological or semantic information, which have different effects on generalization and irregular forms, respectively. The results provide an account of the bases of impairments in verb morphology and show that these impairments can be explained within connectionist models that do not use rules or a separate mechanism for exceptions.},

Some theories postulate abstract surface-independent representations, while other theories postulate stimulus-specific representations. This article reports three experiments investigating the development of abstract representations in artificial grammar learning (AGL), using a methodological approach developed by Conway and Christiansen (2006). In all the experiments, the number of blocks during the exposure phase was manipulated (6 blocks vs. 18 blocks of exposure to sequences). Experiments 1 and 2 investigated both visual and auditory learning where sequences were presented element-by-element. Experiment 3 investigated visual learning using a sequence-by-sequence presentation technique more commonly used in visual AGL studies. Extending previous research (Conway \& Christiansen, 2006) and in support of stimulus-specific accounts, the results of the experiments showed that extended observational learning results in increased stimulus-specific knowledge rather than abstraction towards surface-independent representations.},

Findings from cognitive neuroscience have identified brain structures that subserve feelings and autonomic response, including those induced by emotional music. In the study reported here, we explored whether feelings and autonomic responses can be dissociated by using music, a stimulus that has a strong capacity to induce emotional experiences. We tested two brain regions predicted to be differentially involved in autonomic responsivity (the ventromedial prefrontal cortex) and feeling (the right somatosensory cortex). Patients with damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex were impaired in their ability to generate skin-conductance responses to music, but generated normal judgments of their subjective feelings in response to music. Conversely, patients with damage to the right somatosensory cortex were impaired in their self-rated feelings in response to music, but generated normal skin-conductance responses to music. Control tasks suggested that neither impairment was due to basic defects in hearing the music or in cognitively recognizing the intended emotion of the music. The findings provide evidence for a double dissociation between feeling emotions and autonomic responses to emotions, in response to music stimuli.},

The present 2 studies tested these competing theories using reaction time latencies calculated during a modified context-sentence verification task. The 48 participants were presented serially with 48 two-sentence sets. The priming sentence was a simile, a metaphor, or a filler sentence. The task involved reading the priming sentence and pressing a key to indicate comprehension, then reading a test sentence and indicating whether it logically followed or did not logically follow the prime sentence. The results showed that metaphor sentences were comprehended significantly faster than simile sentences and that this difference was not accounted for by sentence length. There were no differences in response times between prime sentence types or test sentence types. The results therefore are most consistent with Glucksberg's class-inclusion model.},

Performance on the vigilance attention task was significantly improved when the participants consumed a confectionery snack compared to consumption of a noncalorie snack. Participants had significantly higher hit rates and significantly lower miss rates after the confectionery snack. In addition, false alarm rates increased as a function of time for the placebo condition and decreased for the confectionery condition. Thus, the confectionery snack enhanced ability to stay on task for an extended period of time, enabling the children to more accurately identify target information, as well as correctly reject nontarget information. Analysis of the types of errors made also revealed that when the children were in the confectionery condition they were less likely to make more glaring errors. No significant differences were found in tests of digit span, verbal memory, spatial memory or visual perception. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2002 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract).},

Current psycholinguistic models of handwriting involve the conversion of abstract, orthographic representations into motor representations before a sequence of appropriate hand movements is produced. Direct cortical stimulation and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) were used to study the human frontal areas involved in writing. METHODS: Cortical electrical stimulation mapping was used intraoperatively in 12 patients during the removal of brain tumors to identify the areas involved in oral language (sentence reading and naming) and writing, and to spare them during surgery. The fMRI activation experiment involved 12 right-handed and 12 left-handed healthy volunteers using word dictation (without visual control) and 2 control tasks. RESULTS: Direct cortical electrical stimulation of restricted areas rostral to the primary motor hand area (Brodmann area [BA] 6) impaired handwriting in 6 patients, without disturbing hand movements or oral language tasks. In 6 other patients, stimulation of lower frontal regions showed deficits combining handwriting with other language tasks. fMRI also revealed selective activation during word handwriting in left versus right BA6 depending on handedness. This area was anatomically matched to those areas that affected handwriting on electrical stimulation. INTERPRETATION: An area in middle frontal gyrus (BA6) that we have termed the graphemic/motor frontal area supports bridging between orthography and motor programs specific to handwriting.},

The study was a `first pass' at addressing the hedonic and experiential benefits and penalties associated with product use, and at identifying the properties of a product that influence how pleasurable or displeasurable it is to use. Feelings associated with using pleasurable products included security, confidence, pride, excitement and satisfaction. Displeasurable products, meanwhile, were associated with feelings that included annoyance, anxiety, contempt and frustration. The properties of products that were salient in terms of influencing the level of pleasure/displeasure with a product included features, usability, aesthetics, performance and reliability. Responses to questions investigating behavioural correlates to pleasure in product use suggested that pleasurable products were used more regularly and that future purchase choices would be affected by the level of pleasure in product use. It is concluded that the issue of pleasure in product use involves more than usability alone. As the user's representative in the product creation process, the human factors specialist should consider many other factors in order to ensure that the user's experience of product use is maximised.},

  abstract = {Eye movements, eye blinks, cardiac signals, muscle noise,  and line noise present serious problems for electroencephalographic  (EEG) interpretation and analysis when rejecting contaminated  EEG segments results in an unacceptable data loss. Many  methods have been proposed to remove artifacts from EEG  recordings, especially those arising from eye movements  and blinks. Often regression in the time or frequency domain  is performed on parallel EEG and electrooculographic (EOG)  recordings to derive parameters characterizing the appearance  and spread of EOG artifacts in the EEG channels. Because  EEG and ocular activity mix bidirectionally, regressing  out eye artifacts inevitably involves subtracting relevant  EEG signals from each record as well. Regression methods  become even more problematic when a good regressing channel  is not available for each artifact source, as in the case  of muscle artifacts. Use of principal component analysis  (PCA) has been proposed to remove eye artifacts from multichannel  EEG. However, PCA cannot completely separate eye artifacts  from brain signals, especially when they have comparable  amplitudes. Here, we propose a new and generally applicable  method for removing a wide variety of artifacts from EEG  records based on blind source separation by independent  component analysis (ICA). Our results on EEG data collected  from normal and autistic subjects show that ICA can effectively  detect, separate, and remove contamination from a wide  variety of artifactual sources in EEG records with results  comparing favorably with those obtained using regression  and PCA methods. ICA can also be used to analyze blink-related  brain activity.},

  abstract = {In generative grammar there is a traditional distinction between sentence acceptability, having to do with performance, and sentence grammaticality, having to do with competence. The attempt of this paper is to provide a characterization of the notion `acceptable sentence' in English, with some suggestions as to how this characterization might be made universal. The procedure is to outline a set of procedures which are conjectured to be operative in the assignment of a surface structure tree to an input sentence. To some extent, these principles of parsing are modeled on certain parsing techniques formulated by computer scientists for computer languages. These principles account for the high acceptability of right branching structures, outline the role of grammatical function words in sentence perception, describe what seems to be a fixed limit on short-term memory in linguistic processing, and hypothesize the structure of the internal syntactic processing devices. The operation of various classes of transformations with regard to preparing deep structures for input to parsing procedures such as those outlined in the paper is discussed. R\'esum\'e Il existe dans la grammaire g\'en\'erative une distinction traditionnelle entre l'acceptabilit\'e d'une phrase, qui appartient au domaine de la performance, et la grammaticalit\'e d'une phrase, qui appartient au domaine de la comp\'etence. Le but de l'article est de fournir une caract\'erisation de la notion de `phrase acceptable' en anglais et de sugg\'erer comment cette caract\'erisation pourrait avoir une port\'ee universelle. La proc\'edure consiste \`a donner une s\'erie de proc\'edures qu'on pense \^etre op\'erationnelles pour assigner l'arbre de la structure de surface \`a une phrase d'entr\'ee. Ces principes d'analyse sont partiellement inspir\'es par les formules utilis\'ees dans les langages d'informatique. Ces principes qui expliquent la grande acceptabilit\'e de structures de d\'erivation \`a droite, mettent en \'evidence le r\^ole des mots grammatico/fonctionnels dans la perception des phrases, d\'ecrivent ce qui semble \^etre une limite fixe de la m\'emoire \`a court terme dans le traitement linguistique et permettent de faire l'hypoth\'ese sur la structure des m\'ecanismes internes dans le traitement de la syntaxe. Enfin sont discut\'es les diff\'erentes classes de transformation que l'on peut utiliser pour pr\'eparer les structures profondes comme input \`a des proc\'edures d'analyse.},

We conclude that results from neuroimaging support evidence from neuropsychology that syntactic processing does not recruit one specific area. Instead a network of areas including Broca's area and anterior, middle and superior areas of the temporal lobes is involved. However, none of these areas appears to be syntax specific.;}

  abstract = {One of the core aspects of human sentence processing is the ability to detect errors and to recover from erroneous analysis through revision of ambiguous sentences and repair of ungrammatical sentences. In the present study, we used event-related potentials (ERPs) to help identify the nature of these processes by directly comparing ERPs to complex ambiguous sentence structures with and without grammatical violations, and to simpler unambiguous sentence structures with and without grammatical violations. In ambiguous sentences, preference of syntactic analysis was manipulated such that in one condition, the structures agreed with the preferred analysis, and in another condition, a nonpreferred but syntactically correct analysis (garden path) was imposed. Nonpreferred ambiguous structures require revision, whereas ungrammatical structures require repair. We found that distinct ERPs reflected different characteristics of syntactic processing. Specifically, our results are consistent with the idea that a positivity with a posterior distribution across the scalp (posterior P600) is an index of syntactic processing difficulty, including repair and revision, and that a frontally distributed positivity (frontal P600) is related to ambiguity resolution and/ or to an increase in discourse level complexity.},

Similar literal and metaphor priming effects were found in both visual fields across most experimental conditions. However, RH processes also maintained activation of sententially inconsistent literal meanings following metaphoric expressions. These results do not strongly support the RH as the preferred substrate for metaphor comprehension (e.g., Anaki et al., 1998, Bottini et al., 1994), and suggest that processes in both hemispheres can support metaphor comprehension, although not via identical mechanisms. The LH may utilize sentence constraint to select and integrate only contextually relevant literal and metaphoric meanings, whereas the RH may be less sensitive to sentence context and can maintain the activation of some alternative interpretations. This may be potentially useful in situations where an initial understanding must be revised.},

This effect was similar to the positive shifts that have been observed in response to other types of syntactic violations (P600), but qualitatively distinct from the N400 response elicited by semantically/pragmatically anomalous words. These findings are taken as an indication that movement constraints can be applied during the earliest stages of sentence processing, perhaps in conjunction with the creation of phrase structure.

An experimental on-line error detection (ED) paradigm was used to examine how variations in linguistic material (LM) interposed between the subject and the verb affected the detection of number-VAG violations. The time needed for the detection of verbal agreement errors was found to depend largely on the structure and nature of the LM interposed between the subject noun and the verb. Also, ED took more time when the local noun in the interposed sequence mismatched the subject noun in number, than when the 2 nouns matched. Finally, ED seemed to be affected mainly by subject head-noun lexical properties rather than by local noun features. Data suggest that structural properties of the LM interposed between the subject head noun and the verb, and morphological information relative to head noun number, can influence VAG processing.

Individuals read sentences containing free stem, bound stem, and pseudo-prefixed words. In Experiments 1 and 2, a parafoveal display change manipulation indicated that the morphological constituents of a prefixed word are not available for preprocessing in the parafovea as reading times on the target word did not differ for prefixed versus pseudo-prefixed words. Interestingly, parafoveal preview of word initial and word final letters resulted in an equivalent amount orthographic facilitation for all word types. In Experiment 3, a fast priming manipulation indicated that morphological priming effects for prefixed words are obscured during sentence processing. However, the form of the prime did facilitate subsequent word processing for all three word types. The results suggest that English prefixed words are accessed via their whole word form, as there was no evidence of morphological decomposition for prefixed words during sentence processing.

The pivotal new finding was a functional underconnectivity (a lower degree of synchronization) in autism, especially in the connections between frontal and posterior areas during the attribution of mental states. In addition, the frontal ToM regions activated less in participants with autism relative to control participants. In the autism group, an independent psychometric assessment of ToM ability and the activation in the right temporoparietal junction were reliably correlated. The results together provide new evidence for the biological basis of atypical processing of ToM in autism, implicating the underconnectivity between frontal regions and more posterior areas.},

  abstract = {The most frequently used words in English are highly ambiguous; for example, Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary lists 94 meanings for the word "run" as a verb alone. Yet people rarely notice this ambiguity. Solving this puzzle has commanded the efforts of cognitive scientists for many years. The solution most often identified is "context": we use the context of utterance to determine the proper meanings of words and sentences. The problem then becomes specifying the nature of context and how it interacts with the rest of an understanding system. The difficulty becomes especially apparent in the attempt to write a computer program to understand natural language. Lexical ambiguity resolution (LAR), then, is one of the central problems in natural language and computational semantics research.A collection of the best research on LAR available, this volume offers eighteen original papers by leading scientists. Part I, Computer Models, describes nine attempts to discover the processes necessary for disambiguation by implementing programs to do the job. Part II, Empirical Studies, goes into the laboratory setting to examine the nature of the human disambiguation mechanism and the structure of ambiguity itself.A primary goal of this volume is to propose a cognitive science perspective arising out of the conjunction of work and approaches from neuropsychology, psycholinguistics, and artificial intelligence--thereby encouraging a closer cooperation and collaboration among these fields.Lexical Ambiguity Resolution is a valuable and accessible source book for students and cognitive scientists in AI, psycholinguistics, neuropsychology, or theoretical linguistics.},

Low-frequency noise was found to be increased at high-impedance sites relative to low-impedance sites, especially when the recording environment was warm and humid. The increased noise at the high-impedance sites caused an increase in the number of trials needed to obtain statistical significance in analyses of P3 amplitude, but this could be partially mitigated by high-pass filtering and artifact rejection. High electrode impedance did not reduce statistical power for the N1 wave unless the recording environment was warm and humid. Thus, high electrode impedance may increase noise and decrease statistical power under some conditions, but these effects can be reduced by using a cool and dry recording environment and appropriate signal processing methods.},

Large priming effects were found across the 3 SOAs for reaction time (RT) and the N400 effect (the difference between related and unrelated target words). In Exp 2 (12 Ss), auditory primes were paired with visual targets. Here significant behavioral priming was found across the SOAs (larger for 0 and 800 msec), but the N400 effect was significant only for the 200 and 800 msec conditions. It is suggested that the data are most consistent with an amodal semantic system that is tapped by separate modality specific encoding processes.

In the case of bilinguals, the question of how early they can distinguish between the languages of exposure remains unanswered. The goal of this study was to analyze language discrimination capacities in 4-month-old bilingual infants simultaneously exposed to 2 Romance languages belonging to the same rhythmic category, Spanish and Catalan. Using a familiarization-preference procedure, 2 groups of bilingual-to-be infants showed a capacity to discriminate between these 2 familial languages. Moreover, when compared with 2 groups of infants from monolingual environments, the size of the observed effects was the same. These results can be taken as initial evidence of an early capacity to distinguish languages in simultaneous bilingual exposure, thus challenging the hypothesis that language discrimination capacities are delayed in bilinguals.},

Previous event-related potential (ERP) research has been equivocal with regard to whether the N400 component indexes morphological decomposition or the integration of the products of decomposition, a process called semantic composition. In a visual lexical decision task with college students, we recorded ERPs to a well-controlled set of words and nonwords made up of bound morphemes (discern, predict; disject, percern) or free morphemes (cobweb, earring; cobline, bobweb) and monomorphemic control words and nonwords (garlic, minnow; gartus, buzlic). For each of the three morphological types, participants were faster to respond to words than to nonwords. Furthermore, for each of the three morphological types, the amplitude of the N400 was more negative to nonwords than to matched words, an effect indicating that the N400 is more sensitive to the lexicality of the whole stimulus than to the meaningfulness of the constituent parts of the stimulus. The N400 lexicality effect was not significantly different across the three morphological types. To our knowledge, this is the first ERP study to directly compare the processing of printed sets of words composed of bound and free morphemes and monomorphemic control stimuli in order to explore the relative sensitivity of the N400 to morphological decomposition (i.e., the status of the parts) and semantic composition (i.e., the status of the whole). Our findings are consistent with an interpretation of the N400 as an index of a process of semantic composition. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

Rather than leaving it to students to piece together disciplinary responses, eight teaching academics collaborated on the task of exposing students to different types of knowledge in a way that was more than the summing of disciplinary parts. With a part-time network facilitator providing cohesion, network members were able to teach into each other's classes, and share material and student activities across a range of units that included business, zoology, marine science, geography and education. Participants reported that the most positive aspects of the project were the collegiality and support for teaching innovation provided by peers. However, participants also reported being time-poor and overworked. Maintaining the collaboration beyond the initial one year project proved difficult because without funding for the network facilitator, participants were unable to dedicate the time required to meet and collaborate on shared activities. In order to strengthen teacher collaboration in a university whose administrative structures are predominantly discipline-based, there is need for recognition of the benefits of interdisciplinary learning to be matched by recognition of the need for financial and other resources to support collaborative teaching initiatives.},

Experiment 1 established a processing advantage for nouns in German visual lexical decision, using nouns denoting biological and man-made objects as compared to transitive and intransitive verbs. Experiment 2 showed that the noun advantage persisted even when the morphological differences between word categories were reduced by using identical suffixes in nouns and verbs. Overall results suggest that the processing differences cannot be reduced to variables such as frequency, word form, or morphological complexity. Reaction time differences between transitive and intransitive verbs strengthen the role of syntactic information. In line with previous accounts the observed effects are discussed in terms of a category-specific combination of linguistic parameters.

However, the specific function of each of these regions is not yet clear. Here we present evidence that a particular area within human parahippocampal cortex is involved in a critical component of navigation: perceiving the local visual environment. This region, which we name the `parahippocampal place area' (PPA), responds selectively and automatically in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to passively viewed scenes, but only weakly to single objects and not at all to faces. The critical factor for this activation appears to be the presence in the stimulus of information about the layout of local space. The response in the PPA to scenes with spatial layout but no discrete objects (empty rooms) is as strong as the response to complex meaningful scenes containing multiple objects (the same rooms furnished) and over twice as strong as the response to arrays of multiple objects without three-dimensional spatial context (the furniture from these rooms on a blank background). This response is reduced if the surfaces in the scene are rearranged so that they no longer define a coherent space. We propose that the PPA represents places by encoding the geometry of the local environment.},

These constraints arise from the structure and function of the visual system. Thus in the case of color at least, rather than language determining perception (cf. Sapir and Whorf), it is perception that determines language. In deriving the semantic universals from properties of the visual system, one must employ a continuous rather than discrete mathematics, in particular the theory of fuzzy sets. The resulting model of color semantics thus conflicts with the discrete-feature concept of semantic primes shared by structuralists and generativists. It is argued on this basis that discrete-feature semantic theories are of limited accuracy.},

Weinreich, Labov \& Herzog (1968: 188) for a general statement of this position, also many empirical demonstrations already reported, such as those by Labov (1972) and Wang (1969) in phonology and by Bickerton (1973) in syntax). Before taking up this topic, I summarize some recent revisions in the basic color term theory itself.},

  abstract = {Comprehensive models of derived polymorphemic word recognition skill in developing readers, with an emphasis on children with reading difficulty (RD), have not been developed. The purpose of the present study was to model individual differences in polymorphemic word recognition ability at the item level among 5th-grade children (N = 173) oversampled for children with RD using item-response crossed random-effects models. We distinguish between two subtypes of RD children with word recognition problems, those with early-emerging RD and late-emerging RD. An extensive set of predictors representing item-specific knowledge, child-level characteristics, and word-level characteristics were used to predict item-level variance in polymorphemic word recognition. Results indicate that item-specific root word recognition and word familiarity; child-level RD status, morphological awareness, and orthographic choice; word-level frequency and root word family size; and the interactions between morphological awareness and RD status and root word recognition and root transparency predicted individual differences in polymorphemic word recognition item performance. Results are interpreted within a multisource individual difference model of polymorphemic word recognition skill spanning item-specific, child-level, and word-level knowledge.},

  abstract = {It is now well established that phonological -- and orthographic -- codes play a crucial role in the recognition of isolated words and in understanding the sequences of words that comprise a sentence. However, words and sentences are organized with respect to morphological as well as phonological components. It is thus unfortunate that the morpheme has received relatively little attention in the experimental literature, either from psychologists or linguists. Due to recent methodological developments, however, now is an opportune time to address morphological issues.   In the experimental literature, there is a tendency to examine various psycholinguistic processes in English and then to assume that the account given applies with equal significance to English and to other languages. Written languages differ, however, in the extent to which they capture phonological as contrasted with morphological units. Moreover, with respect to the morpheme, languages differ in the principle by which morphemes are connected to form new words.   This volume focuses on morphological processes in word recognition and reading with an eye toward comparing morphological processes with orthographic and phonological processes. Cross-language comparisons are examined as a tool with which to probe universal linguistic processes, and a variety of research methodologies are described. Because it makes the experimental literature in languages other than English more accessible, this book is expected to be of interest to many readers. It also directs attention to the subject of language processing in general -- an issue which is of central interest to cognitive psychologists and linguists as well as educators and clinicians.},

Advantages of this method over block designs include the ability to (a) randomize trial presentations, (b) test for functional correlates of behavioral measures with greater power, (c) directly examine the neural correlates of temporally dissociable components of behavioral trials (e.g., the delay period of a working memory task), and (d) test for differences in the onset time of neural activity evoked by different trial types. Consequently, event-related fMRI has the potential to address a number of cognitive psychology questions with a degree of inferential and statistical power not previously available.},

Supporting the cultural intelligence hypothesis and contradicting the hypothesis that humans simply have more ``general intelligence,'' we found that the children and chimpanzees had very similar cognitive skills for dealing with the physical world but that the children had more sophisticated cognitive skills than either of the ape species for dealing with the social world.},

The frequency of the citation form was a reliable determinant of recognition speed despite the fact that the citation forms were not presented to the Ss and the relationship between the irregularly inflected form and the citation form cannot be established by purely orthographic analysis. This suggests that the recognition process tapped in lexical decisions involves contact of the stimulus with an abstract, intralexical, morphological representation.

An important challenge for these accounts is explaining how abstract concepts, which do not directly call upon sensory or motor information, can be informed by experience. We propose that metaphor is one important vehicle guiding the development and use of abstract concepts. Metaphors allow us to draw on concrete, familiar domains to acquire and reason about abstract concepts. Additionally, repeated metaphoric use drawing on particular aspects of concrete experience can result in the development of new abstract representations. These abstractions, which are derived from embodied experience but lack much of the sensorimotor information associated with it, can then be flexibly applied to understand new situations.},

Results indicate that literate speakers have learned orthographic correlates to lexical stress in English. In addition, the similarities between results in the phonemic and prosodic domains indicate that models of reading developed for the former could be extended to the latter area.

These relationships can be bidirectional; for example, immune cell products can act on the brain, altering mood and cognition, potentially contributing to depression. Although acute physiological alterations may be adaptive in the short term, chronic or repeated provocation can result in damage to health. The central dogma in the field of stress research assumes a stereotyped physiological response to all stressors (the generality model). However, increasing evidence suggests that specific stressful conditions and the specific way an organism appraises these conditions can elicit qualitatively distinct emotional and physiological responses (the integrated specificity model). For example, appraisals of threat (vs. challenge), uncontrollability, and negative social evaluation have been shown to provoke specific psychobiological responses. Emotional responses appear to have specific neural substrates, which can result in differentiated alterations in peripheral physiological systems, so that it is incorrect to presume a uniform stress response.},

This paper shows how insights from linguistic typology can provide cognitive neuroscientists with well-motivated guidelines for interpreting the extant data and charting a future course. At the outset, a fundamental distinction is made between universal and language-particular aspects of word classes. Regarding universals, prototypical nouns involve reference to objects, and their meanings rely primarily on the ventral temporal lobes, which represent the shape features of entities; in contrast, prototypical verbs involve predication of actions, and their meanings rely primarily on posterior middle temporal regions and frontoparietal regions, which represent the visual motion features and somatomotor features of events. Some researchers maintain that focusing on object nouns and action verbs is inappropriate because it conflates the semantic and grammatical properties of each word class. However, this criticism not only ignores the importance of the universal prototypes, but also mistakenly assumes that there are straightforward morphological and/or syntactic criteria for identifying nouns and verbs in particular languages. In fact, at the level of individual languages, the classic method of distributional analysis leads to a proliferation of constructionally based entity-denoting and event-denoting word classes with mismatching memberships, and all of this variation must be taken seriously, not only by linguists, but also by cognitive neuroscientists. Many of these word classes involve remarkably close correspondences between grammar and meaning and hence are highly relevant to the neurobiology of conceptual knowledge, but so far hardly any of them have been investigated from a neurolinguistic perspective.

This is called the ``transposed-letter (TL) Position'' effect. It is shown here that the addition of a prefix eliminates the TL Position effect (i.e., disboey shows as much interference as disoeby relative to a nontransposed control). The TL Position effect also disappears if the prefix creates a nonword when added to the stem (e.g., reboey shows as much interference as reoeby), but there is no interference at all when a nonprefix is added to the stem instead (e.g., raboey or raoeby). The fact that there is strong TL interference for prefixed nonwords (e.g., reboey and reoeby) strongly points to unavoidable morphological decomposition. The disappearance of the TL Position effect when a prefix is added to the stem is ascribed to the reduction in perceptual salience for the initial letter, and this is confirmed when the TL Position was also shown to disappear when the prefix was replaced by digits. The results of the five experiments lead to a consideration of the way in which models of orthographic processing might handle both TL interference and morphological decomposition.},

  abstract = {According to one widely accepted view (Aronoff 1976, 1982), the morphology of a language, because it is part of grammar and trades in structural matters, deals primarily with the internal structure of the potential complex words of a language. These words may not all exist, but they all conform to the morphological structure of the language. By contrast, the lexicon of a language is a list of existing items in the language, those that a speaker has to know because they are arbitrary signs: unpredictable in some way. Most of the items on this list are words, though the lexicon also contains larger units like idioms, and maybe also smaller units like affixes. On this view, in which the regular morphology and the irregular lexicon are separate entities, one might imagine the two having very little to do with one another, since the morphology deals only with potential words and the lexicon only with existing words. In fact, the two systems do have a great deal to do with one another, for two simple reasons. The first is that they serve the same role in a language: both provide words. This overlap has even led some linguists to say that morphology is ``in the lexicon'' (Jensen and Stong-Jensen 1984), although in doing so, these linguists are using the term lexicon in a much broader and different sense, to mean the source of all words, actual and potential, rather than in the narrow sense of a list of unpredictable items that we have inherited from traditional grammar and from Bloomfield (Bloomfield 1933, Zwicky 1989, Aronoff 1994). The second reason is that morphology and the lexicon are interdependent. Most centrally, the morphology, which forms words from words, finds the words that it operates on (its bases) in the lexicon. We will explore each of these interrelations in a separate section.},

However, fundamental differences even exist between distinct mammalian species. Here, we shall discuss the issue of our humanity from a neurobiological and historical perspective.},

No priming was found for physically related words. Thus, "deflecting" spoken clearly in pretraining had no effect on identification of "reflecting" in the test phase. There was strong facilitation from a word with a regular inflectional relationship to the test word. Thus, "reflected" facilitated recognition of "reflecting" almost as much as prior experience of "reflecting" itself, and when responses were scored in terms of the root morpheme, the morphemic effect was the same in the 2 cases. That this was a structural and not a semantic effect was shown by the lack of facilitation between irregularly related words such as "held/holding," "man/men," and "lost/loses." Data suggest that there is a morphological/structural level of analysis that is presemantic, at which these long-term facilitation effects take place. They also challenge the cohort theory of word recognition. (22 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2006 APA, all rights reserved).}

HARKing is defined as presenting a post hoc hypothesis (i.e., one based on or informed by one's results) in one's research report as if it were, in fact, an a priori hypotheses. Several forms of HARKing are identified and survey data are presented that suggests that at least some forms of HARKing are widely practiced and widely seen as inappropriate. I identify several reasons why scientists might HARK. Then I discuss several reasons why scientists ought not to HARK. It is conceded that the question of whether HARKing's costs exceed its benefits is a complex one that ought to be addressed through research, open discussion, and debate. To help stimulate such discussion (and for those such as myself who suspect that HARKing's costs do exceed its benefits), I conclude the article with some suggestions for deterring HARKing.},

All children were monolingual speakers of Italian, which is a morphologically rich language characterized by complex inflectional and derivational paradigms. We developed an experimental protocol inspired by Berko's Wug test and composed of 11 tasks addressing inflectional and derivational processes. Participants were asked to manipulate nonwords of various lexical categories, modeled after the phonotactic structure of Italian, and manipulation involved both word formation and base retrieval. Conditions of the experiments were based on verb conjugation classes differing in frequency, productivity, regularity, and formal transparency. Results confirmed that morphological skills are impaired in dyslexic children, who performed significantly more poorly than their age-matched peers in all tasks. Children with dyslexia were especially challenged by tasks and conditions requiring advanced morphological awareness skills, such as the retrieval of infinitives of infrequent and irregular conjugation classes. The educational and clinical implications of these findings are discussed.},

This traditional view has been recently challenged by showing that temporal attention to a target stimulus is a prerequisite for "automatic" response priming. The event-related potential (ERP) study reported here extends this research by pursuing a somewhat different approach. In two experiments, it was investigated whether masked semantic priming effects can be modulated by temporal attention to the prime using a cueing procedure. We hypothesized that masked priming is amplified when attention is directed to the stimulus stream in the time window of masked prime presentation, even in the absence of any prime awareness. ERPs were recorded while subjects performed a primed lexical decision task. Target words were preceded by semantically related or unrelated masked prime words, which were not consciously identified. A cue stimulus prompted subjects to direct their attention to the stimulus stream either shortly before the masked prime (short cue interval) or a long time interval before. Priming affected the amplitude of the N400 ERP component, an electrophysiological index of semantic processing. Unrelated prime\textendash target pairs elicited a larger N400 than related pairs (N400 priming effect). Most importantly, this masked N400 priming effect was strongest when the cue interval and the stimulus onset asynchronies were short. The present results show that temporal attention to the prime is a prerequisite for obtaining masked N400 priming effects. They also demonstrate that unconscious automatic processes are susceptible to attentional modulation.},

The diverse range of topics covered includes the nature of different writing systems, speech recognition, the structure of lexical information in memory, models of word recognition, speech production, language disorders, subliminal perception, contextual effects on word recognition, and several others. Each of these areas supports an enormous web of theories, data and controversies, for which Henderson has set himself the difficult task of reviewing and critically evaluating. He covers a lot of ground and has succeeded, in my opinion, in creating an essential resource. In sum, this is an excellent book because of the wealth of material that is clearly presented and closely analyzed. Much of the discussion is critical of recent research and theory, sometimes strongly so, but the criticism is fair, and insightful, and it appropriately reflects the state of the field. It helps that the book is as gracefully written as technical prose can be.

Masked words, which were not consciously perceived, as well as visible words were shown to modulate the N400 to meaningfully related target words. Exp 2 required Ss (aged 19-44 yrs) to perform decisions on visual, lexical and semantic features of masked words presented with or without semantically related context words. Ss performed at chance in all tasks. Furthermore, the results exclude the possibility that backward priming has rendered the masked words partially visible.

Effects of morphological relatedness were observed in the later-going time period, however, we failed to observe true regular\textendash irregular dissociations in either experiment.

The 52 native English speakers demonstrated a general preference for the Max Coda analysis and a correlation with reading ability when such an analysis did not correspond with the spoken syllable. The 44 Native Japanese speakers (mean age 27.9 yrs), on the other hand, showed a Max Onset preference regardless of the type of word, while 36 native Mandarin Chinese speakers (mean age 33.1 yrs) showed no preference at all. It is concluded that a maximization of the coda is the optimal representation of polysyllabic words in English and that poorer native readers are more influenced by phonology than are better readers. The way that nonnative readers mentally represent polysyllabic English words is affected by the way such words are structured in their native language, which may not lead to optimal English processing.

Much research on this topic has focused on English past tense morphology, which comprises a regular, rule-like pattern (e.g., bake-baked) and a set of irregular forms that defy a rule-based description (e.g., take-took). Previous studies have used past tense priming to support the theory that the two forms are processed using different cognitive mechanisms. In the present study we investigated this distinction more closely, focusing specifically on whether the regular/irregular distinction is categorical or graded. Priming for regular and irregular forms was compared, as well as for forms that are irregular but display a partial regularity (suffixed irregular verbs, e.g., sleep-slept). Participants performed a lexical decision task with either a masked visual (Experiment 1) or an auditory prime (Experiment 2). We also manipulated prime-target ISI (0 vs. 500 ms), given previous studies indicating this factor might also influence the magnitude and quality of effects. We observed priming effects for both regular and irregular verbs, however the degree of priming of both was influenced by prime modality and processing time. When the prime was masked and presented for 66 ms regulars and suffixed irregulars patterned together, and were different from vowel change irregular forms. As the processing time increased (using longer ISI or cross-modal presentation), all morphologically related words showed facilitation. The results suggest that priming arises as a convergence of orthographic, phonological and semantic overlap that is especially strong for morphologically related words.},

It is often the goal of such efforts that increased interest in STEM careers should stimulate economic growth and enhance innovation. Scientific and educational organizations recommend that efforts to interest students in STEM majors and careers begin at the middle school level, a time when students are developing their own interests and recognizing their academic strengths. These factors have led scholars to call for instruments that effectively measure interest in STEM classes and careers, particularly for middle school students. In response, we leveraged the social cognitive career theory to develop a survey with subscales in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. In this manuscript, we detail the six stages of development of the STEM Career Interest Survey. To investigate the instrument's reliability and psychometric properties, we administered this 44-item survey to over 1,000 middle school students (grades 6\textendash 8) who primarily were in rural, high-poverty districts in the southeastern USA. Confirmatory factor analyses indicate that the STEM-CIS is a strong, single factor instrument and also has four strong, discipline-specific subscales, which allow for the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics subscales to be administered separately or in combination. This instrument should prove helpful in research, evaluation, and professional development to measure STEM career interest in secondary level students.},

Such eliciting conditions do not involve outright syntactic anomaly, deviating from previous reports of P600. Kim and Osterhout (2005) attributed such P600 effects to structural reprocessing that occurs when syntactic cues fail to support a semantically attractive interpretation (`meal' as the Agent of `devouring') and the syntactic cues are overwhelmed; the sentence is therefore perceived as syntactically ill-formed. The current study replicated such findings and also found that altering the syntactic cues in such situations of syntax-semantics conflict (e.g., ``The hearty meal would devour \ldots '') affects the conflict's outcome. P600s were eliminated when sentences contained syntactic cues that required multiple morphosyntactic steps to ``repair''. These sentences elicited a broad, left-anterior negativity at 300\textendash 600ms (LAN). We interpret the reduction in P600 amplitude in terms of ``resistance'' of syntactic cues to reprocessing. We speculate that the LAN may be generated by difficulty retrieving an analysis that satisfies both syntactic and semantic cues, which results when syntactic cues are strong enough to resist opposing semantic cues. This pattern of effects is consistent with partially independent but highly interactive syntactic and semantic processing streams, which often operate collaboratively but can compete for influence over interpretation.},

In the critical sentences (e.g., The meal was devouring\ldots ), the syntactic cues unambiguously signaled an Agent interpretation of the subject noun, whereas the semantic cues supported a Theme interpretation. An Agent interpretation would render the main verb semantically anomalous (as meals do not devour things). Conversely, the Theme interpretation would render the main verb syntactically anomalous (as the -ED form, not the -ING form, is syntactically appropriate for this interpretation). We report that the main verbs in such sentences elicit the P600 effect associated with syntactic anomalies, rather than the N400 effect associated with semantic anomalies. We conclude that, at least under certain conditions, semantic information is ``in control'' of how words are combined during sentence processing.},

Sixty participants read sentences, and ERP effects of semantic anomaly, relative to plausible words, were calculated for each participant. Results suggested qualitatively different ERP patterns across participants: Some individuals generated N400-dominated effects, whereas others generated P600-dominated effects, for the same stimuli. To specify the sources of individual differences in brain responses, we also derived aggregate scores for verbal working memory (WM), nonverbal WM, and language experience/knowledge, based on 6 behavioral measures administered to each participant. Multiple regression analysis pitting these 3 constructs against each other showed that a larger verbal WM capacity was significantly associated with larger P600 and smaller N400 effect amplitudes across individuals, whereas the other constructs did not predict the ERP effects. The results suggest that N400 and P600 brain responses, which may be attributable to semantic integration difficulty and structural processing, respectively, vie for expression when comprehenders encounter semantically unexpected words and that which option wins out is constrained in part by each comprehender's verbal WM capacity.

Subjects were required to decide whether two line drawings, presented sequentially, were the same or different on the basis of whether they were physically identical, shared the same name, or were in the same category. Subjects always made a choice ``same' or ``different'' delayed response whose meaning depended on the operative instruction condition in that block of trials. The ERPs elicited by S1 and S2 with this paradigm from both age groups were of complex morphology, with P300 to both S1 and S2, the E-wave preceding S2, and N400 possibly homologous for children and adults. P300, N400, and E-wave probably had similar functional roles for children and adults as attested by the lack of significant interactions between age groups and the cognitive variables manipulated in the experiment. However, group differences in scalp distribution for one of these components suggest that although they may be generically similar across groups, they are probably not identical with respect to brain generators. In addition, there were group differences in timing of P300 in the two age groups. Overall, the ERP findings suggest that the cognitive processing of children and adults in the same task is different, although the behavioral data lend only partial support for these conclusions.},

This article reviews the research within the global/local paradigm and critically analyzes the assumptions underlyling this paradigm. The extent to which this line of research contributes to understanding the role of wholistic processing on object perception is discussed. It is concluded that one should be very cautious in making inferences about wholistic processing from the processing advantage of the global level of stimulus structure. A distinction is proposed between global properties, defined by their position in the hierarchical structure of the stimulus, and wholistic properties, defined as a function of interrelations among component parts. It is suggested that a direct comparison between processing of wholistic and component properties is needed to support the hypothesis about the perceptual primacy of wholistic processing.

If impaired short-term memory and poor phonological decoding pose the main impediments to IDDs, then they are expected to compensate for these difficulties with a greater reliance on linguistic regularities, to reduce online load. However, if reduced benefits from regularities pose the main bottleneck, IDDs might benefit less than good readers from regularities in spite of their online difficulties. To test that, we administered two experiments. In a novel paradigm of auditory vocabulary acquisition in Hebrew, novel words were presented either with or without familiar morphological structure. Participants with dyslexia showed a reduced recall benefit from familiar structure as compared with controls. However, their recognition was facilitated by morphological structure and did not significantly differ from controls'. In the second experiment, participants read novel words with and without familiar structure. Benefit from structure familiarity for IDDs was significantly smaller than for controls, in spite of IDDs' greater potential benefit from familiar structure due to their reduced overall accuracy. However, when asked to emphasize speed in reading, structure familiarity was found to be beneficial for IDDs, without compromising accuracy. These results imply that accumulative acquisition of sublexical regularities is less efficient in dyslexia, though in some tasks this knowledge is accessible and beneficial.

This asymmetric frequency-blocking effect contrasts with the symmetric pattern (both a speedup for hard items and a slowdown for easy items when they are mixed together) observed with the naming task. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism responsible for the asymmetric blocking effect in the LDT within a model of blocking effect proposed by Mozer, Kinoshita, and Davis (2003), termed theadaptation-to-the-statistics-of- the environment (ASE) model. Experiments 1A and 1B showed that when the same high- and low-frequency words were used, consistent with the existing literature, an asymmetric blocking effect was found in the LDT and a symmetric blocking effect was found in the naming task. Within the ASE model, a symmetric versus asymmetric blocking effect can be explained in terms of different asymptotic rates in subjective estimates of error probability. Experiments 2 and 3 tested and confirmed a prediction of the model based on this assumption that a speedup of hard items would be observed in an LDT with hard items whose subjective error probability asymptotes near zero (low-frequency words with high familiarity ratings that subjects could be certain were words). Implications of the model for task differences in reaction times are discussed.},

Three experiments investigated the formation of the syllabic representation of words using the structural induction phoneme monitoring paradigm in which stimulus lists are disproportionately weighted with words of one syllabic structure. In Experiment 1, two phonological principles of syllabification were compared to determine if one (maximum onset principle) might take precedence over the other (phonotactic illegality) during the formation of the initial structural representation of a word. Results suggest that phonotactic legality overrides the maximum onset principle. In Experiments 2 and 3, phonological and morphological parsings were pitted against each other to determine whether morphological influences in syllabification could be found as early as phonological influences. Results demonstrated that phonology, not morphology, guided syllabification. Experiment 4 demonstrated that the null effects of morphology were likely due to the stage of processing being tapped by the induction paradigm. Findings suggest that the formation of syllabic structure is guided by phonology prior to morphology.},

They observed simultaneous effects of compound frequency, left constituent frequency, and family size early (i.e., before the whole compound has been scanned) and also observed effects of right constituent frequency and family size that emerged after the compound frequency effect. The temporal order of these and other observed effects goes against assumptions of many models of lexical processing. The authors propose specifications for a new multiple-route model of polymorphemic compound processing that is based on time-locked, parallel, and interactive use of all morphological cues as soon as they become even partly available to the visual uptake system.},

Three experiments with 72 undergraduates investigated possible explanations for this nonword facilitation effect, using moderately predictable sentence contexts. Results support the view that nonword facilitation stems from an overestimate of the baseline decision latency when a neutral context condition and sentence context conditions are intermixed. Specifically, it is suggested that context affects a postaccess decision stage during which sentential meaningfulness is used as a basis for making word-nonword discriminations and that nonword facilitation stems from an extra processing stage required for targets following a neutral context. Implications of this interpretation for the effects of sentence context on the recognition of words are discussed. (38 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2002 APA, all rights reserved).},

  abstract = {Macquarie University, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia In the number magnitude decision task (``Is the number bigger/smaller than 5?''), response to a target (e.g., 3) is faster following a masked prime congruent with the target (e.g., 1) than it is following an incongruent prime (e.g., 9). This category congruence effect has been reported to be ``interference-dominant'' relative to a neutral prime (e.g., the \# sign, the number 5) on the basis of the analysis of mean response time (RT). Using RT distribution analysis as well as mean RTs, we identified two bases for this pattern. One relates to the choice of neutral baseline: The \# prime, unlike the digit prime, does not factor in the cost of perceptual transition between the prime and target, and therefore underestimates facilitation and overestimates the interference effect. The second basis of the interference-dominant pattern is a disproportionate slowdown of congruent trials in the slow RT bins. Furthermore, this slowdown is greater for primes that had been used as targets than it is with ``novel'' primes that have not been responded to as targets. We interpret the results as suggesting that the category congruence effect has two components with different time courses\textemdash one based on stimulus-response mapping, and the other on semantic categorization.},

However, there is currently little systematic knowledge about the practice of inquiry-based learning (IBL) in higher education.

Data analysis uncovered the principal forms of IBL, the features of each form, their characteristic educational objectives, and possible disciplinary variations. The findings show that underlying the diversity of language and tasks regarded as IBL there is a limited number of distinct task forms and a broad conception of inquiry that is shared by university teachers. The findings also indicate that IBL is practiced in a wide range of disciplines, in both undergraduate and postgraduate coursework programs, in smaller and larger classes, and in universities which are more and less research intensive.},

We argue that if autistic children have a ``metarepresentational'' deficit in Leslie's (1987, 1988) sense of the term, then they should have difficulty not only with mental representations such as false beliefs, but also with external representations such as photographs. Autistic children's understanding of photographic representations was tested using Zaitchik's (1990) task. This task is modelled on the false belief task (Baron-Cohen, Leslie, \& Frith, 1985: Wimmer \& Perner, 1983) but involves ``false'' photographs where a photographic representation does not conform with the current state of the real world. Like Zaitchik (1990) we found that normal 3 and 4-year-olds found this task as difficult as the false belief task. In sharp contrast, however, the autistic children in our study passed the photograph task but failed the false belief task. As both tasks require the ability to decouple, this evidence challenges the view that autistic children lack ``metarepresentational'' ability in Leslie's sense. However, the results leave open the question of whether autistic children have a metarepresentational ability in the different sense of the term intended by Pylyshyn (1978), that is, representing the relationship between a representation and what it represents.},

  abstract = {This study deals with the effect of stimulus contrast, between 1.3\% and 96\%, on the visual evoked potentials (VEPs) for onset of motion and for pattern reversal of checkerboard stimuli. The VEPs for pattern reversal and for the onset of motion both contain an initial positive peak (P1; peak latency about 120 msec) followed by a later negative peak (N2; peak latency 160\textendash 200 msec). However the P1 peak dominates the pattern-reversal VEP when recorded from the midline occipital lead, where it is maximal, while the N2 peak is larger in the motion-onset VEP, especially when recorded from unipolar lateral occipital leads. Whereas the amplitude of the P1 peak in both the pattern-reversal VEP and the motion-onset VEP decreases with decreasing contrast (becoming undetectable at a contrast of about 2\% for the motion-onset VEP), the amplitude of the N2 peak in both types of VEP does not vary significantly with contrast, above a contrast of 1.3\%. The increase in peak latency with decreasing contrast is also more pronounced for the positive than the negative peaks of both types of VEP. Taking into account the high contrast sensitivity of the magnocellular system (thought to be involved in the processing of motion) compared with the parvocellular system (probably more concerned with the processing of form), our findings suggest that for both motion-onset and pattern-reversal VEPs the negative peak is attributable to the motion-processing magnocellular pathway and the positive peak to the form-processing parvocellular system.},

For example, one talker's /p/ might be physically indistinguishable from another talker's /b/ (cf. lack of invariance). We characterize the computational problem posed by such a subjectively nonstationary world and propose that the speech perception system overcomes this challenge by (a) recognizing previously encountered situations, (b) generalizing to other situations based on previous similar experience, and (c) adapting to novel situations. We formalize this proposal in the ideal adapter framework: (a) to (c) can be understood as inference under uncertainty about the appropriate generative model for the current talker, thereby facilitating robust speech perception despite the lack of invariance. We focus on 2 critical aspects of the ideal adapter. First, in situations that clearly deviate from previous experience, listeners need to adapt. We develop a distributional (belief-updating) learning model of incremental adaptation. The model provides a good fit against known and novel phonetic adaptation data, including perceptual recalibration and selective adaptation. Second, robust speech recognition requires that listeners learn to represent the structured component of cross-situation variability in the speech signal. We discuss how these 2 aspects of the ideal adapter provide a unifying explanation for adaptation, talker-specificity, and generalization across talkers and groups of talkers (e.g., accents and dialects). The ideal adapter provides a guiding framework for future investigations into speech perception and adaptation, and more broadly language comprehension.},

Mapping perceived actions to one's own action repertoire enables direct understanding of others' actions and supports action identification. Joint action relies on shared action representations and involves modeling of others' performance in relation to one's own.

For two of the three subjects, the paper matches were approximately color constant. The hue\textendash saturation matches showed little color constancy. Moreover, the illumination difference between the two displays was always visible. Our data show that simultaneous mechanisms alone (e.g., simultaneous color contrast) alter hues and saturations too little to produce hue constancy.},

  abstract = {The present study investigated the neural correlates of morphological priming in overt Dutch language production using a long-lag priming paradigm. Compound words were read out loud as primes that were morphologically related to picture names (e.g. the word jaszak, `coat pocket' was used for a picture of a coat; Dutch jas), or primes were form-related, but not morphologically related monomorphemic words (e.g. jasmijn, `jasmine'). The morphologically related compounds could be semantically transparent (e.g. eksternest, `magpie nest') or opaque (e.g. eksteroog, lit. `magpie eye,' `corn,' for a picture of a magpie, Dutch ekster). These four priming conditions were complemented by two matched, unrelated conditions. The production of morphologically related, complex words but not the production of form-related words facilitated subsequent picture naming. Also, morphologically related but not form-related words led to a neural priming effect in the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG). The effects did not differ for transparent and opaque relations. The results point to a functional role of LIFG in morphological information processing during language production contrary to previous meta-analytic findings. Specifically, morphological priming effects in language production seem to be independent from semantic overlap. However, further research should confirm the independence of morphological and phonological factors. It is suggested that LIFG subserves word form encoding in language production.

How do listeners identify whether ``they'' has a singular or plural sense? We test the role of explicitly discussing pronouns (e.g., ``Alex uses they/them pronouns''). In three experiments, participants read short stories, like ``Alex went running with Liz. They fell down.'' Answers to ``Who fell down'' indicated whether participants interpreted they as Alex or Alex-and-Liz. We found more singular responses in discourse contexts that make Alex more available: when Alex was either the only person in the context or mentioned first. Critically, the singular interpretation was stronger when participants heard explicit instructions that Alex uses they/them pronouns, even though participants in all conditions had ample opportunity to learn this fact through observation. Results show that the social trend to talk about pronouns has a direct impact on how language is understood.},

By testing at which moment a specific mental content becomes decodable in brain activity, we can characterize the time course of cognitive codes. Most importantly, the manner in which the trained classifiers generalize across time, and from one experimental condition to another, sheds light on the temporal organization of information-processing stages. A repertoire of canonical dynamical patterns is observed across various experiments and brain regions.

Five types of word-prime/word-target trials were used: bird-robin, bird-arm, body-door, body-sparrow, and body-heart. The stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) between prime and target letter string varied between 250 and 2,000 msec. At 2,000-msec SOA, reaction times (RTs) on bird-robin type trials were faster than on xxx-prime trials (facilitation), whereas RTs on bird-arm type trials were slower than on xxx-prime (inhibition). As SOA decreased, the facilitation effect on bird-robin trials remained constant, but the inhibition effect on bird-arm decreased until, at 250-msec SOA, there was no inhibition. For Shift conditions at 2,000-msec SOA, facilitation was obtained on body-door type trials and inhibition was obtained on body-sparrow type. These effects decreased as SOA decreased until there was no facilitation or inhibition. On body-heart type trials, there was an inhibition effect at 2,000 msec SOA, which decreased as SOA decreased until, at 250-msec SOA, it became a facilitation effect. Results support the theory of M. I. Posner and S. R. Snyder (1975) that postulated 2 distinct components of attention: a fast automatic inhibitionless spreading-activation process and a slow limited-capacity conscious-attention mechanism.

We found that participants had a clear preference for using the shared word order when they switched languages, but also aligned their word order choices and code-switching patterns with the confederate. These findings demonstrate how the integration of languages in sentence production depends on processes of syntactic co-activation between languages and on processes of alignment between dialogue partners, and extend the notion of interactive alignment to bilingual speech and code-switching.},

Although prefix words are not more frequent than matched-content words, they engendered a missing-letter effect that was confined to the function morpheme letter. Interpretation of these results in terms of a greater unitization of the phrase as a whole was not supported. Also, ambiguous Hebrew words produced more omissions when interpreted as prefix plus stem combinations than as unprefixed content words. The missing-letter effect reflects postlexical processing, where function morphemes are lost in the transition from structure to meaning.

  year = {2001},
  abstract = {Five unmasked- and four masked-priming lexical decision experiments were carried out in Spanish in order to probe the data structures and processing routines that are exploited during the comprehension of inflected words. In unmasked priming, responses to targets (e.g., mor-os 'Moors') were inhibited when they were preceded by stem-homograph primes ( mor-ir 'to die') compared to unrelated control primes (sill-a 'chair'), and this inhibitory effect was over and above a weak inhibitory effect found for orthographic relative primes (moral 'moral'). Stem-homograph inhibition is interpreted as a consequence of morphological decomposition in lexical access. In additional experiments, this inhibitory effect was observed when targets were preceded by primes that were not themselves stem-homographic with the target, but rather were stem-allomorphic variants of the stem-homograph words (muer-e 'she/he/it dies'). Because target inhibition was found for primes whose inflectional stems are not strictly ambiguous in terms of form, it suggests that the inhibitory effect arises are encoded. The results observed in masked (subliminal) priming contrast with those observed in unmasked priming. When the primes were presented subliminally, stem-homograph priming (mor-ia - mor-os) was facilitative, while orthographic relative priming (moral - mor-os), was neither facilitative nor inhibitory. This was taken as further evidence that stems are decomposed at the form level, and that ambiguous decomposed stems, such as mor-, activate multiple (compatible) lemma representations during the initial stages of lexical access. Moreover, the facilitative effect observed in masked stem-homograph priming suggests that the lemma-level inhibitory mechanism implicated by stem-homograph allomorph priming should not be characterized in terms of built-in inhibitory links between certain lemmas, but rather as a mechanism that is invoked only when mutually exclusive lemma representations compete for selection as the interpretation for an ambiguous form. Furthermore, because stem-homograph priming was inhibitory when participants were aware of the primes, but facilitative when they were not, these priming results suggest that a single lemma interpretation for an ambiguous lexical form must be selected before that form can be consciously perceived as a meaningful word.

This view allows us to interpret in an integrative manner numerous data obtained from very different domains of ERP studies: from biophysics of ERP waves to their relationship to the processing of language, in which verbal behavior is viewed as likewise controlled by the same two basic control processes: feedforward (hypothesis building) and feedback (hypothesis checking). The proposed approach is intentionally simplified, explaining numerous effects on the basis of few assumptions and relating several levels of analysis: neurophysiology, macroelectrical processes (i.e. ERPs), cognition and behavior. It can, therefore, be regarded as a first approximation to a general theory of ERPs.},

  abstract = {Despite the current push toward the practice of evidence-based medicine and comparative effectiveness research, clinicians' decisions may be influenced not only by evidence, but also by cognitive biases. A cognitive bias describes a tendency to make systematic errors in certain circumstances based on cognitive factors rather than evidence. Though health care providers have been shown in several studies to be susceptible to a variety of types of cognitive biases, research on the role of the sunk-cost bias in clinical decision-making is extremely limited. The sunk-cost bias is the tendency to pursue a course of action, even after it has proved to be suboptimal, because resources have been invested in that course of action. This study explores whether health care providers' medical treatment recommendations are affected by prior investments in a course of treatment. Specifically, we surveyed 389 health care providers in a large urban medical center in the United States during August 2009. We asked participants to make a treatment recommendation based on one of four hypothetical clinical scenarios that varied in the source and type of prior investment described. By comparing recommendations across scenarios, we found that providers did not demonstrate a sunk-cost effect; rather, they demonstrated a significant tendency to over-compensate for the effect. In addition, we found that more than one in ten health care providers recommended continuation of an ineffective treatment.},

A critical piece of evidence that could separate the two accounts rests on the existence of full morphological priming, where morphologically related words yield the same amount of priming as repeated words. In this study, participants performed speeded lexical decision on lists of auditory words and non-words, which contained repeated, morphologically related, semantically related and phonologically related pairs of items. In order to minimize the involvement of episodic factors, we increased the prime\textendash target interval and decreased their physical similarity by introducing a change in speaker's voice. We show that under conditions that minimize access to episodic features, the magnitude of repetition priming decreased to attain that of morphological priming. Importantly, morphological and repetition priming for words were always observed in the absence of any semantic and phonological priming, suggesting that they cannot be reduced to formal or meaning overlap. Our results support the view that long-term priming taps both abstract lexical codes with a morphological format and episodic memory components. Further, they show that episodic influences on priming can be modulated by prime\textendash target interval and physical similarity.},

Topics discussed in the area of lexical acquisition are: cues and mechanisms for isolating words in the input; special features of motherese and their role for early word learning; the determination of first word meanings; memory and related processing capacities in early word learning and understanding; and lexical representation and lexical access in early language production. The papers on syntactic development deal with the acquisition of grammatical prosodic features for learning language specific syntactic regularities.Volume 2 of Approaches to Bootstrapping focuses on the interaction between the development of prosodic and morphosyntactic knowledge as evidenced in the early speech of Dutch, English, German, Portugese, Spanish, Danish, Islandic, and Swedish children shedding new light on the relation between universal and language specific aspects of language acquisition. Another section of this volume deals with new approaches to language acquisition using ERP- techniques. The papers discuss in detail the relation between the development of language skills and changes in neurophysiological aspects of the brain. The potentials of these techniques for the development of new tools for an early diagnosis of children who are at risque for developmental language disorders are also pointed out. The closing section contains a synopsis of interactionist approaches to language acquisition, a discussion of the genetic and experiential origin of primitive linguistic elements in acquisition, and a discussion of structural and developmental aspects of bird song in comparison to human language. The two volumes making up Approaches to Bootstrapping present a state-of-the art interdisciplinary and cross-linguistic overview of recent developments in first language acquisition research.},

This was done by measuring event-related brain potentials (ERPs) in a semantic word-detection task involving multiple presentations of primes and critical related and unrelated words in 3 experiments involving visual (Exp 1) and auditory (Exp 2A and 2B) stimuli. Primes varied in their type case (Exp 1) or pitch (Exp 2B) in order to discourage sensory adaptation. Prime satiation and relatedness of the primes to the critical word had interacting effects on ERP amplitude to critical words, particularly within the time-window of the N400 component. Because numerous studies have indicated a role for the N400 in semantic processing, modulation of the N400 relatedness effect by prime satiation (with little or no contribution from perceptual adaptation) suggests that semantic memory can be directly satiated, rather than the cost to semantic processing necessarily resulting from impoverishment of perceptual inputs.

Here we varied the level of perceptual load in a letter-search task and assessed its effect on the conscious perception of a search-irrelevant shape stimulus appearing in the periphery, using a direct measure of awareness (present/absent reports). Detection sensitivity (d{${'}$}) was consistently reduced with high, compared to low, perceptual load but was unaffected by the level of working memory load. Because alternative accounts in terms of expectation, memory, response bias, and goal-neglect due to the more strenuous high load task were ruled out, these experiments clearly demonstrate that high perceptual load determines conscious perception, impairing the ability to merely detect the presence of a stimulus--a phenomenon of load induced blindness.

  abstract = {In standard models of language production or comprehension, the elements which are retrieved from memory and combined into a syntactic structure are ``lemmas'' or ``lexical items.'' Such models implicitly take a ``lexicalist'' approach, which assumes that lexical items store meaning, syntax, and form together, that syntactic and lexical processes are distinct, and that syntactic structure does not extend below the word level. Across the last several decades, linguistic research examining a typologically diverse set of languages has provided strong evidence against this approach. These findings suggest that syntactic processes apply both above and below the ``word'' level, and that both meaning and form are partially determined by the syntactic context. This has significant implications for psychological and neurological models of language processing as well as for the way that we understand different types of aphasia and other language disorders. As a consequence of the lexicalist assumptions of these models, many kinds of sentences that speakers produce and comprehend\textemdash in a variety of languages, including English\textemdash are challenging for them to account for. Here we focus on language production as a case study. In order to move away from lexicalism in psycho- and neuro-linguistics, it is not enough to simply update the syntactic representations of words or phrases; the processing algorithms involved in language production are constrained by the lexicalist representations that they operate on, and thus also need to be reimagined. We provide an overview of the arguments against lexicalism, discuss how lexicalist assumptions are represented in models of language production, and examine the types of phenomena that they struggle to account for as a consequence. We also outline what a non-lexicalist alternative might look like, as a model that does not rely on a lemma representation, but instead represents that knowledge as separate mappings between (a) meaning and syntax and (b) syntax and form, with a single integrated stage for the retrieval and assembly of syntactic structure. By moving away from lexicalist assumptions, this kind of model provides better cross-linguistic coverage and aligns better with contemporary syntactic theory.},

When conceptual activity is sufficiently great to activate a multiple set of corresponding lexical representations, interference is produced in the process of retrieving a single best lexical candidate as the name or translation. The results of Experiment 3 showed further that category interference in bilingual translation occurred only when translation was performed from the first language to the second language, suggesting that the two directions of translation engage different interlanguage connections.

During the evolution of the chronometric paradigm, several key issues have emerged. The issues concern (a) the existence of separable processing stages, (b) the degree to which various stages of processing produce partial outputs before they are completed, and (c) the discrete versus continuous form of the outputs. To obtain added temporal resolution, new reaction-time procedures have been developed, including special response-priming and speed-accuracy decomposition techniques that focus on quantitative patterns of reaction-time distributions and error rates. The present article summarizes these developments, starting with a historical review of chronometric research and proceeding to a survey of recent empirical and theoretical innovations. We also discuss the relevance and potential future impact of complementary work by cognitive psychophysiologists on event-related brain potentials and other physiological variables.},

  abstract = {Bilingual speech requires that the language of utterances be selected prior to articulation. Past research has debated whether the language of speaking can be determined in advance of speech planning and, if not, the level at which it is eventually selected. We argue that the reason that it has been difficult to come to an agreement about language selection is that there is not a single locus of selection. Rather, language selection depends on a set of factors that vary according to the experience of the bilinguals, the demands of the production task, and the degree of activity of the nontarget language. We demonstrate that it is possible to identify some conditions that restrict speech planning to one language alone and others that open the process to cross-language influences. We conclude that the presence of language nonselectivity at all levels of planning spoken utterances renders the system itself fundamentally nonselective.},

  abstract = {One of online social networks' best marketing strategies is viral advertisement. The influence of users on their friends can increase or decrease sales, so businesses are interested in finding influential people and encouraging them to create positive influence. Models and techniques have been proposed to facilitate finding influential people, however most fail to address common online social network problems such as fake friends, spammers and inactive users. We propose a method that uses interaction between social network users to detect the most influential among them. We calculate the relationship strength and influence by capturing the frequency of interactions between users. We tested our model in a simulated social network of 150 users. Results show that our model succeeds in excluding spammers and inactive users from the calculation and in handling fake friendships.},

In this brief response, we first review the history of the Revised Hierarchical Model (RHM), consider the set of issues that it was proposed to address and then evaluate the evidence that supports and fails to support the initial claims of the model. Although fifteen years of new research findings require a number of revisions to the RHM, we argue that the central issues to which the model was addressed, the way in which new lexical forms are mapped to meaning and the consequence of language learning history for lexical processing, cannot be accounted for solely within models of word recognition.

  abstract = {Event related potentials (ERPs) are scalp recorded voltage fluctuations that are time-locked to an event. The ERPs reflect stages of information processing in the sensory-related hierarchical neuronal networks, in the networks of cognitive control as well as in the memory and affective systems of the brain. The ERP amplitude is usually smaller than the amplitude of background EEG so that the reliable ERP is obtained by averaging EEG fragments in multiple trials. Each ERP represents a sum of potentials generated in widely distributed cortical sources. The functionally different sources of ERPs are called components and are associated with distinct hypothetical psychological operations. One way of separating the components is to obtain a difference between the two ERPs performed at conditions which differ in only one respect: presence or absence of a hypothetical operation. Recently methods of blind source separation have been applied in ERP research. They are 1) the single trial independent component analysis (ICA), 2) the group ICA on collection of ERPs in multiple tasks, 3) the group ICA on collection of ERPs in a single task, 4) the method of joint-diagonalization of covariance matrixes on collection of ERPs in a single task. The large amplitude ERPs are quite reliable measures of brain functioning with good to excellent test-retest reliability. Although ERP are quite stable in time they vary substantially from subject to subject reflecting inter-individual fundamental differences in information processing.},

The authors argue that these frameworks have limited ability to explain the success and flexibility of people's real-world judgments and propose an alternative normative framework based on Bayesian inferences over causal models. Deviations from traditional norms of judgment, such as base-rate neglect, may then be explained in terms of a mismatch between the statistics given to people and the causal models they intuitively construct to support probabilistic reasoning. Four experiments show that when a clear mapping can be established from given statistics to the parameters of an intuitive causal model, people are more likely to use the statistics appropriately, and that when the classical and causal Bayesian norms differ in their prescriptions, people's judgments are more consistent with causal Bayesian norms.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Experiment 1 used multisyllabic words that vary in terms of the consistency of component spelling-sound correspondences. The stimuli were regular, regular inconsistent, and exception words analogous to the monosyllabic items used in previous studies. Both regular inconsistent and exception words produced longer naming latencies than regular words. In Experiment 2 these differences between word types were found to be limited to lower frequency items. Experiment 3 showed that effects of number of syllables on naming latency are also limited to lower frequency words. In the final experiment, consistency effects were obtained for both higher and lower frequency words when the stimulus display forced subjects to use syllabic units. Thus, frequency modulates the effects of two aspects of lexical structure--consistency of spelling-sound correspondences and number of syllables. The results suggest that the naming of multisyllabic words draws on some of the same knowledge representations and processes as monosyllabic words; however, naming does not require syllabic decomposition. The results are discussed in the context of current models of naming. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2005 APA, all rights reserved).},

Theorists have taken this to mean that species-specific mechanisms evolved in animals that aid in the detection and recognition of important stimuli. Similar arguments have been made about the mechanisms that underlie the perception of speech in humans. Theories of speech perception present convincing arguments that even the phonetic level of language requires specially evolved mechanisms, because of the extreme complexity involved in the mapping between sound and percept. Phenomena such as categorical perception have been attributed to the workings of these mechanisms. This paper lays out an argument concerning the contribution of animal studies on categorical perception to the special-mechanisms debate. Animals provide a model of auditory-level processing in the absence of phonetic-level processing, and test whether the existence of a phenomenon such as categorical perception necessitates specialized mechanisms. A review of the studies shows that animal demonstrate categorical perception of the voicing and place features. These data, as well as some recent findings on young human infants, are considered with regard to their impact on theories of infant speech perception and on the evolution of speech.},

Our main focus was a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in which the same subjects read the same sentences presented in the same pseudorandomized sequence while performing the same task as in the ERP experiment. Relative to nonviolated sentences, the pragmatic anomalies were associated with an increased hemodynamic response in left temporal and inferior frontal regions and a decreased response in the right medial parietal cortex. Relative to nonviolated sentences, the morphosyntactic anomalies were associated with an increased response in bilateral medial and lateral parietal regions and a decreased response in left temporal and inferior frontal regions.

  abstract = {In 1980, the N400 event-related potential was described in association with semantic anomalies within sentences. When, in 1992, a second waveform, the P600, was reported in association with syntactic anomalies and ambiguities, the story appeared to be complete: the brain respected a distinction between semantic and syntactic representation and processes. Subsequent studies showed that the P600 to syntactic anomalies and ambiguities was modulated by lexical and discourse factors. Most surprisingly, more than a decade after the P600 was first described, a series of studies reported that semantic verb\textendash argument violations, in the absence of any violations or ambiguities of syntax can evoke robust P600 effects and no N400 effects. These observations have raised fundamental questions about the relationship between semantic and syntactic processing in the brain. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the recent studies that have demonstrated P600s to semantic violations in light of several proposed triggers: semantic\textendash thematic attraction, semantic associative relationships, animacy and semantic-thematic violations, plausibility, task, and context. I then discuss these findings in relation to a unifying theory that attempts to bring some of these factors together and to link the P600 produced by semantic verb\textendash argument violations with the P600 evoked by unambiguous syntactic violations and syntactic ambiguities. I suggest that normal language comprehension proceeds along at least two competing neural processing streams: a semantic memory-based mechanism, and a combinatorial mechanism (or mechanisms) that assigns structure to a sentence primarily on the basis of morphosyntactic rules, but also on the basis of certain semantic\textendash thematic constraints. I suggest that conflicts between the different representations that are output by these distinct but interactive streams lead to a continued combinatorial analysis that is reflected by the P600 effect. I discuss some of the implications of this non-syntactocentric, dynamic model of language processing for understanding individual differences, language processing disorders and the neuroanatomical circuitry engaged during language comprehension. Finally, I suggest that that these two processing streams may generalize beyond the language system to real-world visual event comprehension.},

This P600 effect may reflect the processing cost incurred when semantic\textendash thematic relationships between critical verbs and their preceding NP argument(s) bias towards different interpretations to those dictated by their sentences' syntactic structures. We have termed such violations of alternative thematic roles, `thematic role violations.' Semantic\textendash thematic relationships are influenced both by semantic associations and by more basic semantic features, such as a noun's animacy. This study determined whether a P600 effect can be evoked by verbs whose thematic structures are violated by their preceding inanimate NP arguments, even in the absence of close semantic\textendash associative relationships with these arguments or their preceding contexts. ERPs were measured to verbs under four conditions: (1) non-violated (``At breakfast the boys would eat\ldots ''); (2) preceded by introductory clauses and animate NPs that violated their pragmatic expectations but not their thematic structures (``At breakfast the boys would plant\ldots ''); (3) preceded by semantically related contexts but inanimate NPs that violated their thematic structures (``At breakfast the eggs would eat\ldots ''); (4) preceded by semantically unrelated contexts and inanimate NPs that also violated their thematic structures (``At breakfast the eggs would plant\ldots ''). Pragmatically non-thematic role violated verbs preceded by unrelated contexts and animate NPs evoked robust N400 effects and small P600 effects. Thematically violated verbs preceded by inanimate argument NPs evoked robust P600 effects but no N400 effects, regardless of whether these inanimate arguments or their preceding contexts were semantically related or unrelated to these verbs. These findings suggest that semantic-thematic relations, related to animacy constraints on verbs' arguments, are computed online and can immediately impact verb processing within active, English sentences.},

One approach for explaining these findings is to posit distinct semantic and syntactic processing mechanisms, each with distinct time courses. While this approach can explain specific datasets, it cannot account for the wider body of findings. I propose an alternative explanation: a dynamic generative framework in which our goal is to infer the underlying event that best explains the set of inputs encountered at any given time. Within this framework, combinations of semantic and syntactic cues with varying reliabilities are used as evidence to weight probabilistic hypotheses about this event. I further argue that the computational principles of this framework can be extended to understand how we infer situation models during discourse comprehension, and intended messages during spoken communication.},

Reading disabled Ss were split into 2 groups based on a median split of scores on a visual non-word decoding test. The better decoders were called Phonetics, and the poorer decoders were referred to as Dysphonetics. Single syllable, real word stimuli were used, and both rhyming and non-rhyming targets had a 50\% chance for matching orthography. In the visual paradigm the normal readers exhibited a left frontal contingent negative variation (CNV) before targets, a large reduction in frontal N400 for matching orthography (orthographic priming), and a large reduction in parietal N400 for rhyming targets (phonological priming). Dysphonetics had an intact CNV and orthographic priming, but the group's phonological priming was very reduced. Phonetics showed both orthographic and phonological priming but had a marked reduction in their CNV. In the auditory task, controls showed a left parietal N400 priming effect for rhyming targets. Dysphonetics showed a similar bilateral effect. The Phonetics did not show a normal priming effect, but produced evidence for priming at a longer latency.

  abstract = {The present study explores linguistic predictors and behavioural implications of the orthographic alternation between a spaced (bell tower), hyphenated (bell-tower), and concatenated (belltower) format observed in English compound words. On the basis of two English corpora, we model the evolution of spelling for compounds undergoing lexicalisation, as well as define the set of orthographic, distributional, and semantic properties of the compound's constituents that co-determine the preference for one of the available realisations. We explore iconicity and economy as competing motivations for both the diachronic change and synchronous preferences in spelling. Observed patterns of written production closely mirror the demands and strategies of recognition of compound words in reading. Orthographic choices that go against the reader's economy of effort come with a high recognition cost, as evidenced in inflated lexical decision and naming latencies to concatenated compounds that occur in other spelling formats.},

We show that suffix length crucially moderates the use of morphological properties. In words with shorter suffixes, we observe a stronger effect of full-forms (derived word frequency) on reading times than in words with longer suffixes. Also, processing times increase if the base word (plaats) and the suffix (-ing) differ in the amount of information carried by their morphological families (sets of words that share the base or the suffix). We model this imbalance of informativeness in the morphological families with the information-theoretical measure of relative entropy and demonstrate its predictivity for the processing times. The observed processing trade-offs are discussed in the context of current models of morphological processing.},

Two-step statistical analyses using the polynomial regression analysis method revealed significant modifications of latencies of the 3 components, but non-significant modifications of the amplitudes, except for N75. The latency and amplitude of N75 showed a significant inverse linear relationship with the logarithm of the check size, while the P100 and N145 latencies showed significant curvilinear relationships, with minimal latencies at check sizes around 35 min. These findings suggest different physiological properties of N75 from those of P100 and N145, and hence, the necessity to establish normal values for each check size of stimulation, for application in clinical studies.},

More than half of the subjects generated P3 components to word stimuli, but those who did showed similar responses to repeated control presentations of a single word. In addition, it was found that all but the first word in the sentence elicited an ERP with a significant left-greater-than-right asymmetry in the late positivity over temporo-parietal regions. The ERPs to the last words were associated with more late positivity than those to the preceding words. One quarter of the sentences, at random, ended with a word printed in a typeface that was different from that of the preceding words.

Social psychology studies have demonstrated that imitation and mimicry are pervasive, automatic, and facilitate empathy. Neuroscience investigations have demonstrated physiological mechanisms of mirroring at single-cell arid neural-system levels that support the cognitive and social psychology constructs. Why were these neural mechanisms selected, and what is their adaptive advantage? Neural mirroring solves the "problem of other minds" (how we can access and understand the minds of others) and makes intersubjectivity possible, thus facilitating social behavior.},

We explored the nature of the morpheme-based route and its relation to the full-form route by studying recognition of written Finnish nouns in undergraduate students. True case-inflection elicited a processing cost, confirming that such forms are recognized via the more demanding morpheme-based route. A processing cost was also observed for morphologically ambiguous nouns (BEARING vs BEAR+ING) and for pseudoambiguous nouns (PUNISH versus PUN(+)ISH). Neither pseudoinflections (BIA(+)S) nor embedded word-initial pseudostems (PET(+)ROL) evidenced processing costs. Our results suggest when the full form route is active, simultaneous activation of the morpheme-based route requires an opportunity for parsing the input string into a stem and a suffix. The pseudoambiguity effect suggests that the morpheme-based route does not test the morphophonological legality of the parsed string. The processing cost associated with morphologically ambiguous and pseudoambiguous nouns indicates that the relationship between the two routes is inhibitory.

In many product areas, manufacturers have reached a technology ceiling, which simply means that it is increasingly difficult to get ahead of the competition in terms of, for example, functionality, technical reliability or manufacturing costs. As a consequence, design has become a major battleground for manufacturers, and usability is recognized as being a central tenet of good design. This book provides a unique snapshot of current practice in human factors, identifying methods and techniques that work well under tight constraints and providing case study evidence of their effectiveness. The commercial implications of usability are discussed, and special attention is paid to two key trends: inclusive design and smart products. Inclusive design is about meeting the needs of all users with one design, which includes the elderly and the disabled. Smart products are multi-functional products with electronic interfaces containing a vast array of "helpful" functions.

The experimental task elicited clitic pronouns serving as direct objects with finite verbs (lo, la, los, and las). The children who had SLI used clitic pronouns less frequently than their age-matched peers and were less accurate in their use of gender agreement for clitics. No group differences were found for third person singular and plural verb inflections in the preterite tense.

Evidence indicated a central deficit in S's problems with inflected nouns, suggesting differences in the processing of inflectional vs derivational morphology at the semantic level. The S also occasionally produced illegal stem\hspace{0.6em}+\hspace{0.6em}affix combinations appearing in the absence of phonological paraphasias, supporting the view that the phonological output lexicon has a morpheme-based organization in Finnish. Stem representations of inflected nouns in the phonological output lexicon may be allomorph-based because formal transparency of inflection did not affect oral reading or word elicitation performance.

A deep and diverse literature on the functional organization of the human brain is emerging, which has pushed neuroimaging squarely into the scientific mainstream. Because of this rapid growth, there is a great need to effectively collect and synthesize the body of literature in this field. The BrainMap database was created in response to this need as an electronic environment for modeling the human brain through quantitative meta-analysis of the brain mapping literature. BrainMap was originally conceived in 1987 and has received continuous funding from 1988 to 2004. During this time, BrainMap has consistently evolved to meet the challenges of an ever-changing field and continues to strive toward higher levels of applicability. In this article, we discuss BrainMap's structure and utility, and relate its progress and development as a neuroinformatics tool.},

Do not go gentle into that good night. \textemdash Dylan Thomas Death is the mother of beauty . . . -\textemdash Wallace Stevens. \&quot;Sunday Morning\&quot; Introduction These famous lines by Thomas and Stevens are examples of what classical theorists, at least since Aristotle. have referred to as metaphor: instances of novel poetic language in which words like ``mother.\&quot; ``go.\&quot; and ``night\&quot; are not used in their normal everyday senses. In classical theories of language, metaphor was seen as a matter of language not thought. Metaphorical expressions were assumed to be mutually exclusive with the realm of ordinary everyday language: everyday language had no metaphor, and metaphor used mechanisms outside the realm of everyday con- ventional language. ` The classical theory was taken so much for granted over the centuries that many people didn\&\#39;t realize that it was just a theory. The theory was not merely taken to be true. but came to be taken as definitional. The word \&quot;metaphor`` was defined as a novel or poetic linguistic expression where one or more words for a concept are used outside of its normal conventional meaning to express a \&quot;similar\&quot; concept. But such issues are not matters for definitions; they are empirical questions. As a cognitive scientist and a linguist. one asks: What are the generalizations governing the linguistic expressions referred to classically as ``poetic metaphors?\&quot; When this question is answered rigorously. the classical theory turns out to be false. The gen- eralizations goveming poetic metaphorical expressions are not in language, but in thought: They are general mappings across conceptual domains. Moreover, these general principles which take the form of conceptual mappings. apply not just to novel poetic expressions. but to much of ordinary everyday language. In short. the locus of metaphor is not in language at all. but in the way we con- ceptualize one mental domain in terms of another. The general theory of metaphor is given by characterizing such cross-domain mappings. And in the process, everyday abstract concepts like time. states. change. causation. and purpose also turn out to be},

In a grammaticality judgment experiment, Ss were asked to detect as quickly as possible agreement violations: number and/or person in verbal agreement and gender and/or number in nominal agreement. Two factors were manipulated: 1) predictability (number of cues predicting an agreement); 2) violation size (number of dimensions violated). As predicted by structural constraints, nominal violations (intraphrasal) were detected more rapidly than verbal ones (interphrasal). Predictability and violation size did have an effect on judgments of grammaticality but their interactions were more complex than predicted. As hypothesized, for verbal agreement, high predictability and small violation size lengthened detection times and increased errors. For nominal agreement, the pattern is reversed: low predictability and large violation size lengthened detection times and increased errors. These contrastive results obtained in French are discussed in the light of some structural and perceptive factors. They underline the necessity to conduct further studies on each type of agreement independently. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2002 APA, all rights reserved).},

By inducing global knowledge indirectly from local co-occurrence data in a large body of representative text, LSA acquired knowledge about the full vocabulary of English at a comparable rate to schoolchildren. LSA uses no prior linguistic or perceptual similarity knowledge; it is based solely on a general mathematical learning method that achieves powerful inductive effects by extracting the right number of dimensions (e.g., 300) to represent objects and contexts. Relations to other theories, phenomena and problems are sketched. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

  abstract = {This book proposes a new synthesis of the functions of proper names, from a semantic, pragmatic and syntactic perspective. Proper names are approached constructionally, distinguishing prototypical uses from more marked ones such as those in which names are used as common nouns. Since what is traditionally regarded as 'the' class of names turns out to be only one possible function of name-forms (though a prototypical one), the notion of 'proprial lemma' is introduced as the concept behind both proprial and appellative uses of such categories as place names and personal names. New formal arguments are adduced to distinguish proper name function from common noun or pronoun function. The special status of proper names is captured in a unified pragmatic-semantic-syntactic theory: a proper name denotes a unique entity at the level of langue to make it psychosocially salient within a given basic level category. The meaning of the name, if any, does not determine its denotation. An important formal reflection of this characterization of names is their ability to appear in such close appositional constructions as the poet Burns or Fido the dog . The neurolinguistic finding that proper names constitute a separate category is introduced and interpreted within a general linguistic frame of reference. The different kinds of meanings associated with names (categorical, associative, emotive, and grammatical) are shown to be presuppositional in nature. In addition, the book proposes an entirely new classification of proper names as forming a continuum ranging from prototypical (personal and place names) to nonprototypical categories (brand and language names) to citations and autonyms, and a new diachronic classification of family names and nicknames. This book fills an important gap in the current literature, because the most recent linguistic book in English on name theory dates back to 1973. It is explicitly interdisciplinary, taking into account linguistic, philosophical, neurolinguistic, sociolinguistic and dialect geographical aspects of proper names.},

This new concept represents a clear departure from the traditional view that neuronal communication was unidirectional, i.e. from the nerve terminal to the postsynaptic receptor, because the transfer of information via presynaptic receptors occurs in the opposite direction: from the synaptic cleft to the nerve terminals which release the neurotransmitter. Presynaptic release-modulating autoreceptors and heteroreceptors represent suitable targets for pharmacological intervention by exogenous compounds acting as agonists, partial agonists or antagonists. Such compounds may be of therapeutic value by influencing transmitter release presynaptically, and having fewer side effects than the well-established approach of using agonists or antagonist drugs to stimulate or block postsynaptic receptors.},

More specifically, we investigated the process of word recognition of singular and plural nouns in the performance of 24 nonbrain-damaged Ss and 2 Algerian-speaking agrammatic aphasics. Plurals in Arabic involve either suffixation as in the sound plural (e.g., Ibas "dress"/ beta asat "dresses"), or stem-internal changes as in the broken plurals (e.g., kursi "chair") krasa "chairs"). Our findings reveal a differential processing of the 2 forms, indicating whole word access for broken plurals and decomposition into word and suffix for suffixed plurals. Further, the evidence suggests for Algerian Arabic an architecture of the lexicon reflecting a family-like organization which takes into account language-specific features.

  abstract = {Follow the Leader? The Internet has increased the likelihood that our decisions will be influenced by those being made around us. On the one hand, group decision-making can lead to better decisions, but it can also lead to ``herding effects'' that have resulted in financial disasters. Muchnik et al. (p. 647) examined the effect of collective information via a randomized experiment, which involved collaboration with a social news aggregation Web site on which readers could vote and comment on posted comments. Data were collected and analyzed after the Web site administrators arbitrarily voted positively or negatively (or not at all) as the first comment on more than 100,000 posts. False positive entries led to inflated subsequent scores, whereas false negative initial votes had small long-term effects. Both the topic being commented upon and the relationship between the poster and commenter were important. Future efforts will be needed to sort out how to correct for such effects in polls or other collective intelligence systems in order to counter social biases. Our society is increasingly relying on the digitized, aggregated opinions of others to make decisions. We therefore designed and analyzed a large-scale randomized experiment on a social news aggregation Web site to investigate whether knowledge of such aggregates distorts decision-making. Prior ratings created significant bias in individual rating behavior, and positive and negative social influences created asymmetric herding effects. Whereas negative social influence inspired users to correct manipulated ratings, positive social influence increased the likelihood of positive ratings by 32\% and created accumulating positive herding that increased final ratings by 25\% on average. This positive herding was topic-dependent and affected by whether individuals were viewing the opinions of friends or enemies.

  abstract = {Research on the development of word recognition, like that on fluent word recognition, has been strongly influenced by the dual-route model. One route is non-lexical and indirect because access to lexical meaning is mediated by pre-lexical phonological representations assembled through the application of grapheme-to-phoneme correspondence (GPC) rules. The other route, which is independent of the first, is regarded as lexical and direct because orthographic representations of whole words are used to retrieve lexical meanings or post-lexical phonological representations. Evidence is reviewed for two opposing developmental hypotheses based on the dual-route model: fluent readers use both direct and indirect access to lexical meaning, while beginning readers use (1) only indirect access or (2) only direct access. It was concluded that neither mode of access predominates in early reading. A review of other evidence suggests two reasons why the dual-route model fails to provide a satisfactory account of the development of early word recognition. First, it does not offer an adequate characterization of the orthographic units represented in early lexicons. Second, the independence of the two routes prevents lexical information from being acquired through the application of GPC rules. Finally, alternatives to the dual-route model are discussed. One of the most promising is a single process lexical model in which it is proposed that acquisition and performance in word recognition can be accounted for by interactions among orthographic and phonological units of various sizes in the lexicon. R\'esum\'e La recherche sur le d\'eveloppement de la reconnaissance des mots, comme celle sur la reconnaissance des mots par le lecteur avanc\'e, a \'et\'e fortement influenc\'ee par le mod\`ele des deux voies. Une voie est non-lexicale et indirecte parce que l'acc\`es \`a la signification lexicale passe par des repr\'esentations phonologiques pr\'e-lexicales qui sont assembl\'ees par application de r\`egles de correspondance entre graph\`emes et phon\`emes (CGP). L'autre voie, qui est ind\'ependante de la premi\`ere, est lexicale et directe, parce que des repr\'esentations orthographiques des mots complets sont utilis\'ees por acc\'eder \`a la signification lexicale ou aux repr\'esentations phonologiques post-lexicales. Nous passons en revue les donn\'ees concernant deux hypoth\`eses au sujet du d\'eveloppement fond\'ees toutes deux sur le mod\`ele des deux voies: les lecteurs avanc\'ees utilisent \`a la fois l'acc\`es direct et l'acc\`es indirect \`a la signification lexicale, alors que les lecteurs d\'ebutants utilisent soit 1) exclusivement l'acc\`es indirect, soit 2) exclusivement l'acc\`es direct. La conclusion est que aucun des deux modes d'acc\`es ne pr\'edomine chez les d\'ebutants. D'autres donn\'ees sugg\`erent deux raisons pour lesquelles le mod\`ele \`a deux voies ne fournit pas une explication satisfaisante du d\'eveloppement de la reconnaissance des mots. En premier lieu, il n'offre pas une caract\'erisation ad\'equate des unit\'es orthographiques repr\'esent\'ees dans le lexique des d\'ebutants. En deuxi\`eme lieu, l'ind\'ependence des deux voies interdit que l'information lexicale soit acquise par application de r\`egles CGP. Enfin, nous discutons des alternatives au mod\`ele \`a deux voies. La plus prometteuse semble \^etre un mod\`ele lexical \`a processus unique dans lequel l'acquisition et la performance dans la reconnaissance des mots peut \^etre expliqu\'ee par des interactions entre unit\'es orthographiques et phonologiques de diff\'erentes tailles dans le lexique.},

This study investigated the development of syntactic awareness in Cantonese-speaking children. 56 Ss (aged 3-20 yrs) were asked to judge the grammaticality of 40 sentences (18 with word-order changes and 22 with morphological violations) and correct the grammatically deviant sentences. There was a significant age effect on Ss' performance in both judgement and revision tasks. Children scored significantly higher in judging sentences with word order changes than those with morphological violations. They also scored higher on word order revisions than morphological revisions, an unexpected finding. The success of correcting morphological violations varied by morphological marker, apparently according to each marker's degree of obligatory use in the language. It would seem then that syntactic awareness is very much affected by language specific characteristics. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2002 APA, all rights reserved).},

Methods: 'Go,\"A\`inogo' task stimuli were presented either during fMRI scanning or in the gaps between fMRI scans, resulting in ,\"A\`ogradient,\"A\^o and 'no-gradient' ERPs. 'Go,\"A\`inogo' differences in the N2 and P3 components were subjected to conventional ERP analysis, as well as single-trial and reliability analyses. Results: Comparable N2 and P3 enhancement on 'nogo' trials was found in the 'gradient' and 'no-gradient' ERPs. ICA-based signal decomposition resulted in better validity (as indicated by topography), greater stability and lower measurement error of the predicted ERP effects. Conclusions: While there was little or no benefit of acquiring ERPs in the gaps between fMRI scans, ICA decomposition did improve the detection of experimental ERP modulations. Significance: Simultaneous and continuous EEG,\"A\`ifMRI acquisition is preferable to interleaved protocols. ICA-based decomposition is useful not only for artifact cancellation, but also for the extraction of specific ERP components.

The participants in Experiment 1 were asked to read aloud underlined bigrams embedded in five-letter Kana verb-phrases that consisted of two morphemes. Some bigrams were comprised of letters embedded within a morpheme, whereas others crossed the boundary of two morphemes. Naming latency was longer when a target bigram crossed the morphemic boundary than when the bigram letters came from within the morpheme. Experiment 2 showed that this boundary-crossing effect was related to familiarity. When phrases were familiar to readers, no boundary-crossing effect was observed, which suggests that such phrases were processed as one unit. When phrases were less familiar, a clear boundary-crossing effect was observed, suggesting that such phrases were processed as two units. A model of the processing Japanese verb morphology is proposed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2002 APA, all rights reserved).},

  abstract = {In this EEG study, we used pre-registered and exploratory ERP and time-frequency analyses to investigate the resolution of anaphoric and non-anaphoric noun phrases during discourse comprehension. Participants listened to story contexts that described two antecedents, and subsequently read a target sentence with a critical noun phrase that lexically matched one antecedent (`old'), matched two antecedents (`ambiguous'), partially matched one antecedent in terms of semantic features (`partial-match'), or introduced another referent (non-anaphoric, `new'). After each target sentence, participants judged whether the noun referred back to an antecedent (i.e., an `old/new' judgment), which was easiest for ambiguous nouns and hardest for partially matching nouns. The noun-elicited N400 ERP component demonstrated initial sensitivity to repetition and semantic overlap, corresponding to repetition and semantic priming effects, respectively. New and partially matching nouns both elicited a subsequent frontal positivity, which suggested that partially matching anaphors may have been processed as new nouns temporarily. ERPs in an even later time window and ERPs time-locked to sentence-final words suggested that new and partially matching nouns had different effects on comprehension, with partially matching nouns incurring additional processing costs up to the end of the sentence. In contrast to the ERP results, the time-frequency results primarily demonstrated sensitivity to noun repetition, and did not differentiate partially matching anaphors from new nouns. In sum, our results show the ERP and time-frequency effects of referent repetition during discourse comprehension, and demonstrate the potentially demanding nature of establishing the anaphoric meaning of a novel noun.},

Moreover, it has been assumed that the analysis of morphologically complex words (e.g., ``hunter'') occurs only if the meaning of the complex form can be derived from the meanings of its constituents (e.g., ``hunt'' and ``er''). However, recent behavioral work using masked priming has suggested that morphological analysis can occur at an early, orthographic level, with little influence from semantics. The present investigation examined the neurophysiological correlates of masked priming in conditions of a genuine morphological relationship (e.g., ``hunter''-``HUNT''), an apparent morphological relationship (``corner''-``CORN''), and no morphological relationship (``brothel''-``BROTH''). Neural priming was indexed by the reduction of the N400 ERP component associated with targets preceded by related primes, as compared to targets preceded by unrelated primes. The mere appearance of morphological structure (``corner''-``CORN'') resulted in robust behavioral and neural priming, whose magnitude was similar to that observed in pairs with genuine morphological relationship and greater than that in the nonmorphological pairs. The results support a purely structural morphemic segmentation procedure operating in the early stages of visual word perception.},

Thirty SEMs and 30 PUNs were presented to 16 healthy subjects, and their EEG data were concurrently recorded. PUNs consequently showed a larger N400 amplitude than did SEMs, without a specified scalp site, which implies that PUNs induce greater surprise and semantic violation. Meanwhile, SEMs induced a larger P600-like amplitude at the posterior site, which implies that, in order to understand SEMs, higher working memory loads are needed to form novel associations and successfully frame-shift. A possible explanation is the differing logical mechanisms used to understand SEMs and PUNs: the former builds on semantic relationships, the latter on phonological causality.},

  abstract = {It is proposed that threat-evoked anxiety and spatial Working Memory (WM) rely on a common visuospatial attention mechanism. A prediction of this hypothesis is that spatial but not verbal WM should be disrupted in conditions of threat anxiety. Participants performed verbal and spatial n-back WM tasks in the presence or absence of threat of shock (shocks were not delivered). The presence of anxiety was assessed via heart rate recordings and self-report. Both measures clearly distinguished between WM blocks associated with threat of shock (Threat) and blocks, in which threat was absent (Safety). Performance on the spatial WM task was impaired in Threat relative to Safety. Furthermore, the more anxiety participants reported and the higher their heart rate in Threat compared to Safety, the more impaired was their spatial WM performance. This effect was not observed for verbal WM. The results indicate selective disruption of spatial WM performance by threat-evoked anxiety, interpreted in terms of more overlap in visuospatial attention between anxiety and spatial WM vs anxiety and verbal WM.

Lexical (word/nonword) decisions about a word such as "nurse" are faster when it follows a related word such as "doctor". The present experiment examines the consequence of varying the proportion of semantically related adjacent words. The effect of semantic context is found to depend on the overall proportion of related word pairs. More facilitation occurs when there is a greater proportion of related word pairs. This finding contradicts theories of word recognition which account for context effects solely by postulating transient increases in the aecessibility of only those words semantically related to the particular preceding stimuli encountered by the observer. An adequate theory must include an account of strategic or adaptive processes in which the past usefulness of contextual information modulates its influence in the word recognition process.},

  abstract = {One important debate in psycholinguistics concerns the nature of morphological decomposition processes in visual word recognition (e.g., darkness = \{dark\} + \{-ness\}). One theory claims that these processes arise during orthographic analysis and prior to accessing meaning (Rastle \& Davis, 2008), and another argues that these processes arise through greater temporal overlap between the activation of orthographic and semantic information (Feldman, O'Connor, \& Moscoso del Prado Mart{$\surd\neq$}n, 2009). This issue has been the subject of intense debate in studies using masked priming but has yet to be resolved unequivocally. The present study takes another approach to resolving this controversy by examining brain potentials as participants made lexical decisions to unprimed morphological (darkness), pseudomorphological (corner), and nonmorphological (brothel) stimuli. Results revealed a difference from ,\`a\textordmasculine 190 ms between the nonmorphological condition and the other 2 conditions (which showed no differentiation), a likely correlate of morphological processing reliant exclusively on orthography. Only 60,\"A\`i70 ms later was there evidence of the activation of semantic information, when the pseudomorphological condition diverged from the other 2 conditions. These results provide unambiguous support for a hierarchical model of morphological processing whereby decomposition is based initially on orthographic analysis and is only later constrained by semantic information.

In Experiment 1, a first-constituent frequency manipulation revealed solid effects for long compounds in early and late processing measures, but no effects for short compounds. In contrast, in Experiment 2, a whole-word frequency manipulation elicited solid effects for short compounds in early and late processing measures, but mainly late effects for long compounds. A race model, incorporating a headstart for the decomposition route in case whole-word information of complex words cannot be extracted in a single fixation, can explain the pattern of results.

We investigated the N400 brain potential time-locked to words preceded by fully visible primes. At ,\`a\textordmasculine 300,\"A\`i380 ms, N400 was equally attenuated in the semantically "transparent" condition (hunter-HUNT) and semantically "opaque" condition (corner-CORN). In the transparent condition, N400 remained attenuated after 380 ms, whereas in the opaque condition it returned to the level of a nonmorphological form condition (brothel-BROTH). This pattern of N400 priming is consistent with an orthography-based, morphological decomposition mechanism, "licensed" at a later stage by semantic information.

It was found that it is the otherworldly rewards in all the samples that explain by far the major part of the variance in the readiness to bear religious costs. These results suggest that individuals do tend to make rational choices even when it comes to religion. Based on their beliefs, they are ready to accept religious costs approximately to the level of their expectation of otherworldly rewards.

Results suggest that measures of extrinsic, intrinsic, and quest religiosity are not entirely applicable in most of the cultures observed. Nevertheless, it was possible to discern abbreviated cross-culturally valid scales for each dimension. The strength and direction of the correlation between psychological well-being and a particular type of religious orientation proved to depend substantially upon culture. More importantly, the cultural environment plays a crucial role in shaping the relationship between general measures of religiosity and psychological well-being. According to the data, higher general levels of religiosity at the societal level are linked to more positive correlations between religiosity and psychological well-being. The overall picture leads to the conclusion that there is no culturally universal pattern in the relationship between measures of religiosity and psychological well-being and that the particular cultural and religious context should always be considered in studies dealing with this issue.

However, there is still debate about the locus of this effect (lexical versus nonlexical, strategic versus automatic). In the present study, we explored whether orthographic effects in auditory word recognition could be structural-residual effects that reflect changes in the quality or specificity of phonological representations during learning to read. To address this possibility, the neighbour generation task was used. This task is particularly well suited to explore the off-line nature of phonological representations. Indeed, in two experiments, we found that orthographic information affected the nature of phonological representations. Participants produced phonographic neighbours (i.e., words that share both orthographic and phonological neighbourhoods) significantly more often than would be expected by chance. The existence of an orthography effect in an off-line phonological task therefore suggests that orthographic information participates in the specification of phonological representations.},

  abstract = {Substantial research has been undertaken to understand the relationship between spelling and sound, but we know little about the relationship between spelling and meaning in alphabetic writing systems. We present a computational analysis of English writing in which we develop new constructs to describe this relationship. Diagnosticity captures the amount of meaningful information in a given spelling, whereas specificity estimates the degree of dispersion of this meaning across different spellings for a particular sound sequence. Using these two constructs, we demonstrate that particular suffix spellings tend to be reserved for particular meaningful functions. We then show across three paradigms (nonword classification, spelling, and eye tracking during sentence reading) that this form of regularity between spelling and meaning influences the behaviour of skilled readers, and that the degree of this behavioural sensitivity mirrors the strength of spelling-to-meaning regularities in the writing system. We close by arguing that English spelling may have become fractionated such that the high degree of spelling-sound inconsistency maximises the transmission of meaningful information.},

Previous L1 and L2 reading research has demonstrated that readers can acquire new vocabulary as a result of reading, but can they also acquire formal properties of the second language grammatical system? The 181 Ss in the present study had no previous knowledge of future tense morphology such that, as they read the passage used in the study, they encountered the target form for the first time, which is an accented a on the end of an infinitive. Several variables were manipulated: the frequency with which the target form appeared in the input passages; the learner-readers' orientation to the task (neutral, meaning oriented, or form oriented); and cues to meaning (the presence or absence of future-oriented adverbials). Effects of these variables were measured on both comprehension and input processing immediately after reading, 2 wks later, and 1 mo later. Comprehension was measured with a free-written recall and a multiple-choice comprehension test. Input processing was measured with a multiple-choice form recognition test and a modified cloze-form production test. The results indicate that all three variables have some effect on comprehension and input processing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2002 APA, all rights reserved).},

Other evaluations are done at the single-subject level, and so fail to benefit from the reduction of noise that data averaging or aggregation potentially provides. To overcome these weaknesses, we have developed a general approach to modeling individual differences using families of cognitive models in which different groups of subjects are identified as having different psychological behavior. Separate models with separate parameterizations are applied to each group of subjects, and Bayesian model selection is used to determine the appropriate number of groups. We evaluate this individual differences approach in a simulation study and show that it is superior in terms of the key modeling goals of prediction and understanding. We also provide two practical demonstrations of the approach, one using the ALCOVE model of category learning with data from four previously analyzed category learning experiments, the other using multidimensional scaling representational models with previously analyzed similarity data for colors. In both demonstrations, meaningful individual differences are found and the psychological models are able to account for this variation through interpretable differences in parameterization. The results highlight the potential of extending cognitive models to consider individual differences.},

Participants were more successful inducing a correct problem-solving rule when they were provided with annotated examples rather than nonannotated examples. The effects of example similarity varied depending on learning context. In Experiment 1, by presenting an example and problem simultaneously, a direct comparison was possible between the cases. When the examples were similar, participants relied on superficial analogies that hurt learning. When an example was dissimilar from the given problem, participants appeared to study the example first to induce a solution procedure and then apply the rule to the problem, thus resulting in better learning and transfer. However, in Experiment 2 where the example and problem were presented in a sequential manner, the effect disappeared because the learning context did not support a direct comparison. We conclude that comparison is not inherently good for promoting learning and transfer, rather its effect depends on whether it supports relational mapping that is essential for schema acquisition.

In this article, we observe that productive combinatoriality is difficult to evolve, because it requires multiple components to be put in place simultaneously for it to function. To understand how it nevertheless evolved in human language, we focus on combinatoriality in phonology, for which most evidence is available. We discuss findings and theories from three domains: linguistics (descriptive, experimental and corpus linguistics), comparative biology (including some fossil indicators) and (computer) models. We tentatively conclude that many of the biological prerequisites for combinatorial phonology and compositional semantics are shared with other animals, but that a uniquely human pressure for large vocabularies and uniquely human processes of cultural evolution are key in understanding the origins of combinatoriality in language.},

The most common type of expected sensory events are those generated as a consequence of self-generated actions. Using H2 15O PET, we studied brain responses to such predictable sensory events (tones) and to similar unpredictable events and especially how the processing of predictable sensory events is modified by the context of a causative self-generated action. Increases in activity when the tones were unpredictable were seen in the inferior and superior temporal lobe bilaterally, the right parahippocampal gyrus and right parietal cortex. Self-generated actions produced activity in a number of motor and premotor areas, including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. We observed an interaction between the predictability of stimuli and self-generated actions in several areas, including the medial posterior cingulate cortex, left insula, dorsomedial thalamus, superior colliculus and right inferior temporal cortex. This modulation of activity associated with stimulus predictability in the context of self-generated actions implies that these areas may be involved in self-monitoring processes. Detection of expected stimuli and the detection of the sensory consequences of self-generated actions appear to be functionally distinct processes, and are carried out in different cortical areas. These observations support theoretical approaches to cognition that postulate the existence of a self-monitoring system.},

Additionally, the relative contribution of statistical learning alongside other cognitive measures known to be related to reading has not been examined. This study of sixty-five Norwegian school children (M\,=\,10.3\,years) found that performance on an independent statistical learning task predicted a small, but unique amount of variance in reading ability in Norwegian, even when a number of other reading-related cognitive skills were taken into account. This suggests that children's implicit learning of statistical regularities is associated with proficiency with written language in a semi-transparent orthography such as Norwegian.},

In contrast, in cases in which the base-rate or the individuating information is lengthy and/or is presented late in the informational sequence, the tendency to use it is greater under ample versus limited resources.

This has been taken as evidence for morphological decomposition in Finnish and full-form recognition of inflected nouns in Swedish. While most previous imaging studies had studied the two morphological processing routes (decomposition and storage) within the same language and often by comparing regular vs. irregular forms, we employed a cross-language setting and a direct contrast between morphologically complex vs. simple words. We subjected high-proficient Finnish\textendash{} Swedish early bilinguals to a visual lexical decision task with inflected vs. monomorphemic Finnish and Swedish nouns while measuring their brain activation by fMRI.

  abstract = {Our use of language depends upon two capacities: a mental lexicon of memorized words and a mental grammar of rules that underlie the sequential and hierarchical composition of lexical forms into predictably structured larger words, phrases, and sentences. The declarative/procedural model posits that the lexicon/grammar distinction in language is tied to the distinction between two well-studied brain memory systems. On this view, the memorization and use of at least simple words (those with noncompositional, that is, arbitrary form-meaning pairings) depends upon an associative memory of distributed representations that is subserved by temporal-lobe circuits previously implicated in the learning and use of fact and event knowledge. This ``declarative memory'' system appears to be specialized for learning arbitrarily related information (i.e., for associative binding). In contrast, the acquisition and use of grammatical rules that underlie symbol manipulation is subserved by frontal/basal-ganglia circuits previously implicated in the implicit (nonconscious) learning and expression of motor and cognitive ``skills'' and ``habits'' (e.g., from simple motor acts to skilled game playing). This ``procedural'' system may be specialized for computing sequences. This novel view of lexicon and grammar offers an alternative to the two main competing theoretical frameworks. It shares the perspective of traditional dual-mechanism theories in positing that the mental lexicon and a symbol-manipulating mental grammar are subserved by distinct computational components that may be linked to distinct brain structures. However, it diverges from these theories where they assume components dedicated to each of the two language capacities (that is, domain-specific) and in their common assumption that lexical memory is a rote list of items. Conversely, while it shares with single-mechanism theories the perspective that the two capacities are subserved by domain-independent computational mechanisms, it diverges from them where they link both capacities to a single associative memory system with broad anatomic distribution. The declarative/procedural model, but neither traditional dual- nor single-mechanism models, predicts double dissociations between lexicon and grammar, with associations among associative memory properties, memorized words and facts, and temporal-lobe structures, and among symbol-manipulation properties, grammatical rule products, motor skills, and frontal/basal-ganglia structures. In order to contrast lexicon and grammar while holding other factors constant, we have focused our investigations of the declarative/procedural model on morphologically complex word forms. Morphological transformations that are (largely) unproductive (e.g., in go\textemdash went, solemn\textemdash solemnity) are hypothesized to depend upon declarative memory. These have been contrasted with morphological transformations that are fully productive (e.g., in walk\textemdash walked, happy\textemdash happiness), whose computation is posited to be solely dependent upon grammatical rules subserved by the procedural system. Here evidence is presented from studies that use a range of psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic approaches with children and adults. It is argued that converging evidence from these studies supports the declarative/procedural model of lexicon and grammar.},

A linear mixed-effects model was applied to single trial event-related potentials for 207 visually presented concrete words measured on total number of features (semantic richness), imageability, and number of visual motion, color, visual form, smell, taste, sound, and function features. Significant influences of multiple feature types occurred before 200ms, suggesting parallel neural computation of word form and conceptual knowledge during language comprehension. Function and visual motion features most prominently influenced neural activity, underscoring the importance of action-related knowledge in computing word meaning.

Behaviorally, there is evidence that recognition of inflected nouns elicits a processing cost (i.e., longer reaction times and higher error rates) in comparison to matched monomorphemic words. We aimed to reveal whether the processing cost stems from decomposition at the early visual word form level or from re-composition at the later semantic-syntactic level. The ERPs showed no early effects for morphology, but revealed an interaction with word frequency at a late N400-type component, as well as a late positive component that was larger for inflected words. These results suggest that the processing cost stems mainly from the semantic-syntactic level. We also studied the features of the morphological decomposition route by investigating the recognition of pseudowords carrying real morphemes. The results showed no differences between inflected vs. uninflected pseudowords with a false stem, but differences in relation to those with a real stem, suggesting that a recognizable stem is needed to initiate the decomposition route.

  abstract = {This study examines the social functions of codeswitching (CS) between Standard Arabic (SA) and Dialectal Arabic (DA). The data came from thirty-five audio and video recordings in the domains of religious lectures, political debates, and soccer commentaries. The findings suggest that speakers create a functional division between the two varieties by designating issues of importance, complexity, and seriousness to SA, the High code, and aligning less important, less serious, and accessible topics with DA, the Low code. The CS patterns therefore reproduce the unequal social values and distribution of SA and DA in the Arabic sociolinguistic landscape and simultaneously call for a reconceptualization of the notion of diglossia as presented in Ferguson's (1959) work. Other functions of CS as a marker of speakers' attitudes and as an index of pan-Arab or Muslim identities are discussed.

Participants were 18 dyslexic and 18 normally reading, native Hebrew-speaking male university students, aged 18 to 27 years. Obtained results confirmed the hypothesis that Hebrew readers used lexical-morphological properties of words to identify their grammatical roles. However, the morphologically based strategy acquired full expression only in the presence of the verb, which in the Hebrew sentence fulfills the central role. Seemingly, readers use a few different procedures to identify the grammatical roles of words. Selection of a particular strategy seems to be influenced by diverse factors, including syntactic and lexical-morphological characteristics of the stimuli and level of reading skills. In addition, the results showed significant differences in sentence processing between normal and dyslexic readers, as reflected by ERP measures. These results are in line with the hypothesis, suggesting the existence of a syntactic processing "weakness" in readers with dyslexia. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2002 APA, all rights reserved).},

In monkeys, neurons in the upper stages of the ventral visual pathway respond to complex images such as faces and objects and show some degree of invariance to metric properties such as the stimulus size, position and viewing angle. We have previously shown that neurons in the human medial temporal lobe (MTL) fire selectively to images of faces, animals, objects or scenes. Here we report on a remarkable subset of MTL neurons that are selectively activated by strikingly different pictures of given individuals, landmarks or objects and in some cases even by letter strings with their names. These results suggest an invariant, sparse and explicit code, which might be important in the transformation of complex visual percepts into long-term and more abstract memories.},

In the present contribution, we contrast such accounts with a different reading of the phenomenon based on the notion of inductive confirmation as defined by contemporary Bayesian theorists. Averaging rule hypotheses along with the random error model and many other existing proposals are shown to all imply that conjunction fallacy rates would rise as the perceived probability of the added conjunct does. By contrast, our account predicts that the conjunction fallacy depends on the added conjunct being perceived as inductively confirmed. Four studies are reported in which the judged probability versus confirmation of the added conjunct have been systematically manipulated and dissociated. The results consistently favor a confirmation\textendash theoretic account of the conjunction fallacy against competing views. Our proposal is also discussed in connection with related issues in the study of human inductive reasoning. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Participants were first familiarized with a lexicon of pseudoletter strings, each comprising an affix-like chunk that either followed (Experiment 1) or preceded (Experiment 2) a random character sequence. In the absence of any linguistic information, chunks could be defined only by their statistical properties - similarly to affixes in the real language, chunks occurred frequently and assumed a specific position within strings. In a later testing phase, we found that participants were more likely to attribute a previously unseen string to the familiarization lexicon if it contained an affix, and if the affix appeared in its typical position. Importantly, these findings suggest that readers may chunk words using a general, language-agnostic cognitive mechanism that captures statistical regularities in the learning materials.},

  abstract = {In studies of event-related potentials (ERPs), short interstimulus intervals (ISIs) are often employed to investigate certain neural or psychological phenomena. At short ISIs, however, the ERP responses to successive stimuli may overlap, thereby distorting the ERP averages. This paper describes a signal processing approach for analyzing the distortion of ERP averages due to such overlap. In general, the distortion is modeled in terms of mathematical convolutions of the ERP waveform elicited by each type of adjacent stimulus with the corresponding distribution in time of those stimuli relative to the averaging epoch. Using this framework, a number of implications of ERP overlap for experimental design and interpretation are examined, with special emphasis given to selective attention paradigms. It is shown that the possibility of confound due to ERP overlap is widespread in short-ISI experiments, and even the widely used procedure of stimulus randomization does not necessarily control for differential distortion of the ERPs to attended versus inattended stimuli. Problems due to ERP overlap can be particularly serious in short-ISI studies that examine how ERPs (and associated perceptual processes) are influenced by the nature of the preceding stimulus (i.e., stimulus sequence effects). A set of algorithms is presented for estimating and removing the residual distortion due to response overlap from recorded ERP averages. The use of these algorithms, collectively termed the Adjacent Response (Adjar) Technique, can alleviate many of the overlaprelated problems that arise when short ISIs are used, thereby enhancing the power of the ERP technique.},

In the current study, we investigated the time course and neural sources of spoken inflected and derived words using simultaneously recorded electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) responses. Ten participants (native speakers) listened to inflected, derived, and monomorphemic Finnish words and judged their acceptability. EEG and MEG responses were time-locked to both the stimulus onset and the critical point (suffix onset for complex words, uniqueness point for monomorphemic words). The ERP results showed that inflected words elicited a larger left-lateralized negativity than derived and monomorphemic words approximately 200 ms after the critical point. Source modeling of MEG responses showed one bilateral source in the superior temporal area {$\sim$}100 ms after the critical point, with derived words eliciting stronger source amplitudes than inflected and monomorphemic words in the right hemisphere. Source modeling also showed two sources in the temporal cortex approximately 200 ms after the critical point. There, inflected words showed a more systematic pattern in source locations and elicited temporally distinct source activity in comparison to the derived word condition. The current results provide electrophysiological evidence for at least partially distinct cortical processing of spoken inflected and derived words. In general, the results support models of morphological processing stating that during the recognition of inflected words, the constituent morphemes are accessed separately. With regard to derived words, stem and suffix morphemes might be at least initially activated along with the whole word representation.

This mechanism appears to occur through activation of a population of action-coding cells known as mirror neurons (MN). In the adult motor cortex, performing actions and observing human movement reduces the magnitude of the mu (8\textendash 13~Hz) rhythm, possibly reflecting MN system activity. Despite the wealth of information available regarding the adult MN system, little is known about its existence in children. Here, we used EEG to probe mu rhythm modulation in 15 children during observation and execution of hand actions. Our data show that mu rhythm attenuation occurs in children under 11~years old during observation of hand movements. Similarly to what has been reported in adults, observation of goal/object-orientated movement produces greater modulation of the mu rhythm than intransitive movement. These data confirm the existence of an observation\textendash execution matching system in the immature human brain and may be of clinical value in the understanding of neurodevelopmental disorders associated with a faulty MN system, such as autism spectrum disorder.},

The time resolution of the method is better than 1 ms and the spatial discrimination is, under favorable circumstances, 2-3 mm for sources in the cerebral cortex. In MEG studies, the weak 10 fT-1 pT magnetic fields produced by electric currents flowing in neurons are measured with multichannel SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device) gradiometers. The sites in the cerebral cortex that are activated by a stimulus can be found from the detected magnetic-field distribution, provided that appropriate assumptions about the source render the solution of the inverse problem unique. Many interesting properties of the working human brain can be studied, including spontaneous activity and signal processing following external stimuli. For clinical purposes, determination of the locations of epileptic foci is of interest. The authors begin with a general introduction and a short discussion of the neural basis of MEG. The mathematical theory of the method is then explained in detail, followed by a thorough description of MEG instrumentation, data analysis, and practical construction of multi-SQUID devices. Finally, several MEG experiments performed in the authors' laboratory are described, covering studies of evoked responses and of spontaneous activity in both healthy and diseased brains.

Results of three investigations are reported. The first required development of objective measures of category coherence and consistency to clarify questions about healthy control performance on the freesorting colour categorisation task used in previous studies. Between-participant consistency was found to be only moderate and the number of colour categories generated was found to vary markedly between individuals. The second study involved longitudinal neuropsychological examination of a patient whose colour categorisation strategy was monitored in the context of a progressive decline in language due to semantic dementia. Performance on measures of category coherence and consistency was found to be relatively stable over time despite a profound decline in the patient's colour language. In a final investigation we demonstrated that, for both the patient and controls, between- and within-participant consistency were higher than expected by (a) random sorting and (b) sorting perceptually similar chips together. These findings indicate that the maintenance of colour categorisation need not depend on language. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

There is a striking isomorphism between the 3 fundamental forms of pretend play and 3 crucial logical properties of mental state expressions in language. This isomorphism points to a common underlying form of internal representation that is here called metarepresentation. A performance model, the "decoupler," is outlined embodying ideas about how an infant might compute the complex function postulated to underlie pretend play. This model also reveals pretense as an early manifestation of the ability to understand mental states. Aspects of later preschool development, both normal and abnormal, are discussed in the light of the new model. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

A character decision task was used in which frequency characteristics of the radicals within a character and radical status of the components within a noncharacter were manipulated. The frequency of the right-hand radical affected responses to 2-radical characters, whereas the radical status of both left and right components affected noncharacter responses. Furthermore, the impact of radical frequency was shown to be sensitive to radical position. For 3-radical characters, it appeared that the frequency of a compound radical (composed of 2 subradicals) had no effect on responses, whereas the frequency of the subradicals did. It is concluded that all simple radicals are independently activated in the process of character recognition. Compound radicals are not activated in this way despite their common occurrence. The results are considered within a multilevel interactive-activation framework incorporating position sensitivity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2002 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract).},

The theory of lexical access reviewed in this article covers a sequence of processing stages beginning with the speaker's focusing on a target concept and ending with the initiation of articulation. The initial stages of preparation are concerned with lexical selection, which is zooming in on the appropriate lexical item in the mental lexicon. The following stages concern form encoding, i.e., retrieving a word's morphemic phonological codes, syllabifying the word, and accessing the corresponding articulatory gestures. The theory is based on chronometric measurements of spoken word production, obtained, for instance, in picture-naming tasks. The theory is largely computationally implemented. It provides a handle on the analysis of multiword utterance production as well as a guide to the analysis and design of neuroimaging studies of spoken utterance production.},

When viewing a scene, we seem to use detailed representations of object properties and interobject relations to achieve a sense of continuity across views. Yet, several recent studies show that human observers fail to detect changes to objects and object properties when localized retinal information signaling a change is masked or eliminated (e.g., by eye movements). However, these studies changed arbitrarily chosen objects which may have been outside the focus of attention. We draw on previous research showing the importance of spatiotemporal information for tracking objects by creating short motion pictures in which objects in both arbitrary locations and the very center of attention were changed. Adult observers failed to notice changes in both cases, even when the sole actor in a scene transformed into another person across an instantaneous change in camera angle (or ``cut'').},

With 60 Ss, Exp 3 was designed to replicate the influence of prime word frequency on morphological priming using frequency-matched orthographic and unrelated primes and a larger stimulus set than in Exp 1. Exp 4 hypothesized that morphological priming effects should interact with the cumulative root frequency of target words. Exps 1 and 3 showed that only high frequency morphologically related primes produce significantly faster response times compared to orthographic control primes. In Exp 4 similar levels of morphological priming were obtained to free root targets with high and low cumulative root frequencies.

When Dutch compounds are written with an artificial space, they reveal no effect of type count, which shows that the differential effect for the English open compounds is not superficial. The final experiment provides converging evidence for the lexical consequences of the space in English compounds. Decision latencies for English simplex words are better predicted from counts of the morphological family that include concatenated and hyphenated but not open family members.

We focus on the question of whether semantic transparency is best viewed as a property of the entire multimorphemic string or as a property of constituent morphemes. Accordingly, we investigated the processing of English compound nouns that were categorized in terms of the semantic transparency of each of their constituents. Fully transparent such as bedroom are those in which the meanings of each of the constituents are transparently represented in the meaning of the compound as a whole. These compounds were contrasted with compounds such as strawberry, in which only the second constituent is semantically transparent, jailbird, in which only the first constituent is transparent, and hogwash, in which neither constituent is semantically transparent. We propose that significant insights can be achieved through such analysis of the transparency of individual morphemes. The two experiments that we report present evidence that both semantically transparent compounds and semantically opaque compounds show morphological constituency. The semantic transparency of the morphological head (the second constituent in a morphologically right-headed language such as English) was found to play a significant role in overall lexical decision latencies, in patterns of decomposition, and in the effects of stimulus repetition within the experiment.},

Repetition priming effects in lexical decision tasks are stronger for low-frequency words than for high-frequency words. This frequency attenuation effect creates problems for frequency-ordered search models that assume a relatively stable frequency effect. It was posited that frequency attenuation is a product of the involvement of the episodic memory system in the lexical decision process. This hypothesis was supported by the demonstration of constant repetition effects for high- and low-frequency words when the priming stimulus was masked; the masking was assumed to minimize the influence of any possible episodic trace of the prime. It was further shown that long-term repetition effects were much less reliable when the S was not required to make a lexical decision response to the prime. When a response was required, the expected frequency attenuation effect was restored. It is concluded that normal repetition effects consist of 2 components: a very brief lexical effect that is independent of frequency and a long-term episodic effect that is sensitive to frequency.

  abstract = {Background: Derived words have constituted an important bridge between aphasiology and psycholinguistics by addressing the extent to which morphology affects representation and processing in the mind/brain. Aims: Our goal was to assess how properties of whole words and their overlapping substrings affect the manner in which English derivationally suffixed words are recognised and produced. Methods \& Procedures: We probed the processing of multimorphemic words containing strings of two derivational suffixes by healthy adult participants, employing both a progressive demasking naming task and a typing task. The progressive demasking paradigm that we employed integrates word recognition and production by requiring that a participant recognises a progressively demasked stimulus and then say it as quickly as possible. The typing task allowed us to focus on segment by segment aspects of processing during production by enabling us to construct per-letter typing times for each region of a word. Outcomes \& Results: We found converging influences across the tasks that correspond to the properties of roots, stems, suffixes and suffix strings. Conclusions: We interpret these effects to accord with a perspective that emphasises the dynamic nature of the lexical processing system and massive interconnectivity within it. This has implications for unimpaired processing and for the word processing challenges experienced by people with aphasia. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

A lively introduction to the subject, this textbook is intended for undergraduates with relatively little background in linguistics. Providing data from a wide variety of languages, it includes hands-on activities such as 'challenge' boxes, designed to encourage students to gather their own data and analyze it, work with data on websites, perform simple experiments, and discuss topics with each other. There is also an extensive introduction to the terms and concepts necessary for analyzing words. Unlike other textbooks it anticipates the question 'is it a real word?' and tackles it head on by looking at the distinction between dictionaries and the mental lexicon. This second edition has been thoroughly updated, including new examples and exercises as well as a detailed introduction to using linguistic corpora to find and analyze morphological data.},

There is now solid evidence that, at least in the laboratory, the entire bottleneck can be completely bypassed under favorable combinations of circumstances.

We measured the N170, assumed to be an index of holistic processing, and the N400, an index of semantic activation. Surprisingly, mixed-case words elicited a larger N170 effect than either consistent lowercase words (Experiment 1) or consistent uppercase words (Experiment 2). The N400, meanwhile, was unaffected by case mixing. In contrast, LEET words (e.g., T4BL3 instead of TABLE), which preserve overall word shape but distort letter shape, increased the N400 but did not reduce the N170 (Experiment 3). The results indicate that the N170 is in fact not a reliable index of holistic word processing. Implications for word recognition models are discussed.},

CISs thus seem to be like adults': IR forms are tied to the lexicon but regular forms are computed by a default rule, and words are represented as morphological tree structures reflecting their derivation from basic word roots. Such structures, which determine how novel complex words are derived and interpreted, also govern whether words with IR sound patterns will be regularized. Results suggest that morphological structure and a distinction between mechanisms for regular and IR inflection may be inherent to the design of children's language systems.

In Experiment 2, we adapted a clinical test to analyze interocular alignment in photographic portraits of established artists to assess the likelihood that the artists had normal stereopsis. If eyes are misaligned, stereo vision is compromised. Our results demonstrate that artists have poorer stereopsis on average than the general population. Of course, the majority of artists have perfectly aligned eyes, so poor eye alignment is not a necessary condition for artistic success. In addition, there are many people with strabismus who show no evidence of exceptional artistic talent. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

As ELAN components seem to be exclusively elicited by word category violations (phrase structure violations), they have been taken as strong empirical support for syntax-first models of sentence processing and have gained considerable impact on psycholinguistic theory in a variety of domains. The present article reviews relevant ELAN studies and raises a number of serious issues concerning the reliability and validity of the findings.

We conclude that \textendash{} despite the apparent wealth of ELAN data \textendash{} the functional significance of these findings remains largely unclear. The present paper does not claim to have falsified the existence of ELANs or syntax-related early frontal negativities.

They also focus not on Theory of Mind, narrowly defined as the understanding of false beliefs, but rather on children's growing understanding of other persons more generally--what the authors call simply social understanding. The authors are primarily concerned with two levels of social understanding: (1) the understanding of other persons as intentional agents, whose behavior is governed by goals and perceptions, and (2) the understanding of other persons as mental agents, whose behavior is governed by goals (desires) and beliefs, including ones that are false. The authors' central claim is that the relationship between linguistic communication and social understanding is different depending on which of these two levels is involved. The chapter concludes by stating that certain forms of social cognition-reading communicative intentions--are thus prerequisite for the acquisition and use of linguistic conventions, and the use of linguistic conventions, including syntactic constructions, in discourse is prerequisite for certain other forms of social cognition--understanding false beliefs.

To explore the role of attentional selection of the relevant stimulus attribute in these task-switch costs, we measured eye fixations in participants cued to identify either a face or a letter displayed on its forehead. With only 200 ms between cue and stimulus onsets, the eyes fixated the currently relevant region of the stimulus less and the irrelevant region more on switch than on repeat trials, at stimulus onset and for 500 ms thereafter, in a pattern suggestive of delayed orientation of attention to the relevant region on switch trials. With 800 ms to prepare, both switch costs and inappropriate fixations were reduced, but on switch trials participants still tended (relative to repeat trials) to fixate the now-irrelevant region more at stimulus onset and to maintain fixation on, or refixate, the irrelevant region more during the next 500 ms. The size of this attentional persistence was associated with differences in performance costs between and within participants. We suggest that reorientation of attention is an important, albeit somewhat neglected and controversial, component of advance task-set reconfiguration and that the task-set inertia (or reactivation) to which many attribute the residual task-switch cost seen after preparation includes inertia in (or reactivation of) attentional parameters.

Testing human adults (n = 35, 21 females), we document, in the context of a classical visual SL task, divergent rhythmic EEG activity in the interstimulus delay periods within patterns versus between patterns (i.e., pattern transitions). Our findings reveal increased oscillatory activity in the beta band ({$\sim$}20 Hz) at triplet transitions that indexes learning: it emerges with increased pattern repetitions; and importantly, it is highly correlated with behavioral learning outcomes. These findings hold the promise of converging on an online measure of learning regularities and provide important theoretical insights regarding the mechanisms of SL and prediction., SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Statistical learning has become a major theoretical construct in cognitive science, providing the primary means by which organisms learn about regularities in the environment. As such, it is a critical building block for basic and higher-order cognitive functions. Here we identify, for the first time, a spectral neural index in the time window before stimulus presentation, which evolves with increased pattern exposure, and is predictive of learning performance. The manifestation of learning that is revealed, not in stimulus processing but in the blank interval between stimuli, makes a direct link between the fields of statistical learning on the one hand and either prediction or consolidation on the other hand, suggesting a possible mechanistic account of visual statistical learning.},

In English, semantic transparency is necessary to produce morphological priming in cross-modal priming, but not as clearly so in masked priming. The available reports of priming effects for opaque prime-target pairs are not as clear-cut as to rule out an explanation in terms of orthographic overlap. Experiment 1 was set out to clarify that issue in French. The novel notion of "pseudo-derivation" we introduce proved useful to show that surface morphology alone can produce priming effects in masked priming. In contrast, pure orthographic overlap produces marginal inhibition. Experiment 2 used auditory-visual cross-modal priming and showed that only semantically transparent words facilitate the recognition of their base.

It is shown that Gibson's work reveals traces of his contacts with F. Heider and E. Brunswik, and that D. Marr explicitly picks up key elements of Gibson's work. Heider, Gibson, and Marr are interpreted as naturalists in their emphasis on the role of the environment as a separate and irreducible level of explanation in theories of perception.

The results show significant main effects for both variables for the first time in Spanish, as well as for the interaction between the two. However, pair analysis shows that the Base Frequency effect is not significant when the Affix Productivity is low, while the Affix Productivity effect is produced regardless of the Base Frequency. The results for the main effects show a morphological representation in the lexicon, whilst the results of pair comparisons suggest a different representation of stems and affixes in the lexicon. These results support the idea that complex words incorporating unproductive affixes are processed differently from words incorporating productive affixes. The results are finally explained in terms of a hierarchical model of morphological processing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

Although I am invited to conferences such as the (lovely) one that inspired this volume on the basis of my computational modeling work, my real interest is in language\textemdash not models\textemdash and in reading as a particular realization of language. We usually emphasize the differences between language and reading: one evolved in the species, the other was invented (via writing); one is learned through immersion and exposure, the other through instruction and feedback; one is universal, the other is not; and so forth. Yet despite these differences, the same principles govern most aspects of both. For example, whatever the biological predispositions for spoken language turn out to be (e.g., whether they are specific to language, or language takes advantage of many enabling capacities), children still have to learn the language to which they are exposed. The procedures that underlie this learning are, apparently, the same as those that govern learning to read. Thus, the same computational architectures and learning procedures are being used to explain statistical learning in language acquisition and the child's later transition into reading (Saffran, 2009; Seidenberg, 2007). For such reasons, I see more similarities across reading and language than are usually acknowledged. One can study reading qua reading, which is interesting enough, but also because it sheds light on language more broadly. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (chapter)},

The first approach involves using structural magnetic resonance images to provide a common reference frame for the mathematical estimation of neural activity, and the second approach involves parallel experimental manipulations and converging evidence. At present, neither approach is entirely satisfactory, and the integration of different measures of neural activity, therefore, requires a combination of direct and indirect approaches.

This article reviews some of the recent ERP studies of attention, focusing on studies that isolate the operation of attention in specific cognitive subsystems such as perception, working memory, and response selection. Several conclusions are drawn. First, under some conditions attention modulates the initial feedforward volley of neural activity in intermediate visual processing areas. Second, these early effects can be observed for both the voluntary allocation of attention and for the automatic capture of attention following a peripheral visual transient. Third, these effects are present not only when attention is directed to a location in 2-dimensional space, but also when attention is directed to one of two spatially overlapping surfaces. Fourth, attention does not modulate sensory activity unless sensory systems are overloaded; when sensory systems are not taxed, attention may instead operate to influence memory or response processes. That is, attention operates to mitigate information overload in whichever cognitive subsystems are overloaded by a particular combination of stimuli and task.

We argue that this diverse pattern of results reflects the ways different complex words are stored and processed.

  abstract = {The first point of evidence opposing rule-based learning is the disconnect between the idea of children's initial and exclusive reliance on a phonetic rule in spelling and the growing amount of evidence showing that children young enough to be in this stage demonstrate sensitivity to morphological regularities in their spelling. This is the case for the 5- and 6-year-olds in Treiman and Cassar's (1996) study, and the 6-year-olds in Deacon and [Bryant]'s (2006) study. (Such a concern also exists in relation to the early findings of sensitivity to graphotactic regularities; e.g., [Pacton] et al., 2001). Certainly, some of these discrepancies can be accounted for by the context of assessment. For example, there is some evidence that increasing task demands (e.g., introducing a secondary task or varying the quantity spelt) increases agreement errors for French spellers (e.g., Hupet, Fayol, \& Schelstraete, 1998). For English, a similar pattern emerges based on the metric of analysis. The spelling tund (instead of tuned) is categorized as a phonetic spelling not influenced by morphology by [Nunes] et al. (1997b) who focused on the correct use of -ed, but [Treiman] and Cassar ( 1996) considered such a spelling as influenced by morphology if /n/ was transcribed accurately more often in two- than in one-morpheme words (e.g., tuned vs. brand). More important, not all findings can be discounted on this basis. Deacon and Bryant (2005; 2006) recently demonstrated that young children demonstrate an appreciation of the relationship between morphemes and spelling even though the coding required correct spellings of whole morphemes and not just single letters (see also Deacon, 2008). Young children's appreciation of the role of morphemes in spelling goes directly against the predictions made for Nunes et al.'s stage of initially phonetic spelling. Nous pr\'esentons notre point de vue sur la mani\`ere dont les enfants apprennent l'orthographe en nous appuyant sur une \'evaluation de la recherche r\'ecente en mati\`ere de d\'eveloppement des comp\'etences en lecture et en \'ecriture des enfants francophones et anglophones. Nous nous penchons sur la question de l'apprentissage des codes graphotactiques (combinaisons de lettres admises), apr\`es quoi nous examinons plus \`a fond la mani\`ere dont les enfants apprennent la position des morph\`emes (les plus petites unit\'es de sens de la langue). Nous mettons en lumi\`ere les diff\'erences entre les r\'esultats de la recherche r\'ecente et les mod\`eles traditionnels voulant que les enfants se servent de l'information graphotactique et morphologique relativement tard dans leur apprentissage de l'orthographe, et selon lesquels le d\'eveloppement des comp\'etences, en particulier la reconnaissance des codes morphologiques, s'appuie essentiellement sur l'apprentissage des r\`egles d'orthographe. En fait, il semble que les enfants en tr\`es bas \^age soient influenc\'es, dans leur apprentissage de l'orthographe, par les structures graphotactiques comme par les structures morphologiques et qu'en d\'efinitive, ils ne d\'ependent pas exclusivement des r\`egles pour \'ecrire. C'est pourquoi nous formulons la possibilit\'e que les enfants pourraient apprendre \`a reconna\^itre les codes graphotactiques et morphologiques de l'orthographe par apprentissage statistique.},

  abstract = {Inquiry-based learning is gaining popularity in science curricula, international research and development projects as well as teaching. One of the underlying reasons is that its success can be significantly improved due to the recent technical developments that allow the inquiry process to be supported by electronic learning environments. Inquiry-based learning is often organized into inquiry phases that together form an inquiry cycle. However, different variations on what is called the inquiry cycle can be found throughout the literature. The current article focuses on identifying and summarizing the core features of inquiry-based learning by means of a systematic literature review and develops a synthesized inquiry cycle that combines the strengths of existing inquiry-based learning frameworks. The review was conducted using the EBSCO host Library; a total of 32 articles describing inquiry phases or whole inquiry cycles were selected based on specific search criteria. An analysis of the articles resulted in the identification of five distinct general inquiry phases: Orientation, Conceptualization, Investigation, Conclusion, and Discussion. Some of these phases are divided into sub-phases. In particular, the Conceptualization phase is divided into two (alternative) sub-phases, Questioning and Hypothesis Generation; the Investigation phase is divided into three sub-phases, Exploration or Experimentation leading to Data Interpretation; and the Discussion phase is divided into two sub-phases, Reflection and Communication. No framework bringing together all of these phases and sub-phases was found in the literature. Thus, a synthesized framework was developed to describe an inquiry cycle in which all of these phases and sub-phases would be present. In this framework, inquiry-based learning begins with Orientation and flows through Conceptualization to Investigation, where several cycles are possible. Inquiry-based learning usually ends with the Conclusion phase. The Discussion phase (which includes Communication and Reflection) is potentially present at every point during inquiry-based learning and connects to all the other phases, because it can occur at any time during (discussion in-action) or after inquiry-based learning when looking back (discussion on-action).},

This is particularly true for the representation of morphologically complex words. In this paper the authors analyzed the performance of a patient (M.B.) affected by agrammatism and dyslexia. M.B. was required to read aloud simple and morphologically complex words. The patient's pattern of errors was interpreted as the result of a predominant use of the lexical routine (phonological dyslexia). Three reading tasks were developed which allowed testing of M.B.'s ability to read morphologically complex words (reading of regular and irregular plurals; reading of high- and low-frequency singular and plural nouns; reading of evaluative suffixes). Errors were determined by frequency effect rather than by type of suffix (i.e., inflectional or derivational). High-frequency morphologically complex items seemed to meet stored representations, thus avoiding the parsing procedures that are required for less frequent items. These results are in keeping with dual route models of lexical representation of morphologically complex words. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2002 APA, all rights reserved).},

Her study also reveals that the lexically encoded person and/or number features of plural pronouns appear to be incompatible with the interpretation they achieve in context. Based on her study, Borthen claims that there is an asymmetry between plural and singular pronouns. In this paper, we first discuss the special use of the third person plural pronoun they in English, the so-called singular they, and then the special use of the third person singular pronoun ta `he/she/it' in Chinese, providing supportive evidence for Borthen's findings that pronouns are referentially less well-behaved, but counter-evidence against her claim about the asymmetry between plural and singular pronouns.},

Results show that the patients' morpholexical rule system is preserved for inflection and derivation, but not for compounds. The word-building component is spared for derivation but not in compounding. The 2 patients differ with respect to direct lexical access of the grammatical features and lexical paradigms of inflected forms. This is fully functional in 1 but not the other patient. Findings suggest a syntactic deficit rather than a morphological one in some agrammatic patients. An appendix of general characteristic of the Italian lexicon is included.

It also proposes a principle for guiding prescriptive recommendations in the future as well as a theoretical framework and procedure for predicting the consequences of prescriptive recommendations. The procedure illustrates a hypothetical prescription: the substitution of singular they for prescriptive he. Projected benefits the prescription include neutral connotation, naturalness, simplicity, and lexical availability. Projected costs include covert and overt referential ambiguity; partial ambiguity; conceptual inaccuracy; loss of precision, imageability, impact, and memorability; bizarreness involving certain referents and case forms; distancing and dehumanizing connotations; unavailability of the `he or she' denotation; potentially disruptive and long-lasting side effects on other areas of the language. Procedures are also illustrated for determining the relative frequency of such costs and benefits and for estimating the relative disruptiveness of the costs normal language use. Implications of the data for several issues general interest to linguistics and psychology are explored.

In keeping with current research and theory, we look at three aspects of morphological awareness: morphological structure awareness, morphological analysis and morphological decoding. Using a regression-based approach, we identified 64 poor and average comprehenders out of a large sample of children in grade 3. Our results show that poor comprehenders and average comprehenders performed remarkably similar on morphological structure awareness, analysis, and decoding. Poor comprehenders performed more poorly than average comprehenders only on word analogy, a specific measure of morphological awareness. These results identify an area with which poor comprehenders are likely to struggle, while simultaneously providing evidence for areas of relative strength within this population.},

The materials included both transparently-related (i.e., the second word incorporated the pronunciation of the first, as in person-personal) and complexly-related word pairs (i.e., the second word involved some change in pronunciation, as in atom-atomic). Across two experiments, these items were presented in either oral or written form along with various tests of reading ability, intelligence and phonological awareness. The results indicate that children's recognition of derivational relationships improved with grade-level. As anticipated, there was also a significant association between sensitivity to derivational relatedness and decoding ability which remains significant even when the word pairs were orally presented and even when phonological awareness in taken into account. Both phonological awareness and sensitivity to morphological structure emerge as important factors in decoding skill in the later elementary grades.},

We exposed participants to a stream of stimuli, then tested them immediately after, or 24h after, exposure, with separate tests meant to measure implicit and explicit knowledge. To measure implicit learning, we analyzed reaction times during a rapid serial visual presentation detection task; for explicit learning, we used a matching questionnaire. Subjects' reaction time performance indicated that they did implicitly learn the exposed sequences, and furthermore, this learning was unrelated to explicit learning. These learning effects were observed both immediately after exposure and after a 24-h delay. These experiments offer concrete evidence that statistical learning is long-term and that the learning involves implicit learning mechanisms.},

This concept has a legitimate role to play in science only if the colloquial usage relates to a coherent body of evidence. We examine many different candidates for the post of scientific successor of the folk concept of innateness. We argue that none of these candidates is entirely satisfactory. Some of the candidates are more interesting and useful than others, but the interesting candidates are not equivalent to each other and the empirical and evidential relations between them are far from clear. Researchers have treated the various scientific notions that capture some aspect of the folk concept of innateness as equivalent to each other or at least as tracking properties that are strongly correlated with each other. But whether these correlations exist is an empirical issue. This empirical issue has not been thoroughly investigated because in the attempt to create a bridge between the folk view and their theories, researchers have often assumed that the properties must somehow cluster. Rather than making further attempts to import the folk concept of innateness into the sciences, efforts should now be made to focus on the empirical questions raised by the debates and pave the way to a better way of studying the development of living organisms. Such empirical questions must be answered before it can be decided whether a good scientific successor \textendash{} in the form of a concept that refers to a collection of biologically significant properties that tend to co-occur \textendash{} can be identified or whether the concept of innateness deserves no place in science.},

Dupuis-Roy et al. reported a large positive correlation between the use of the mouth region and rapid correct answers [Journal of Vision 9 (2009) 1\textendash 8]. Given the chromatic information in this region, they hypothesized that the extraction of chromatic and achromatic cues may have different time courses. Here, we tested this hypothesis directly: 110 participants categorized the sex of 300 face images whose chromatic and achromatic content was partially revealed through time (200 ms) and space using randomly located spatio-temporal Gaussian apertures (i.e. the Bubbles technique). This also allowed us to directly compare, for the first time, the relative importance of chromatic and achromatic facial cues for sex categorization. Results showed that face-sex categorization relies mostly on achromatic (luminance) information concentrated in the eye and eyebrow regions, especially the left eye and eyebrow. Additional analyses indicated that chromatic information located in the mouth/philtrum region was used earlier\textemdash peaking as early as 35 ms after stimulus onset\textemdash than achromatic information in the eye regions\textemdash peaking between 165 and 176 ms after stimulus onset\textemdash as was speculated by Dupuis-Roy et al. A non-linear analysis failed to support Yip and Sinha's proposal that processing of chromatic variations can improve subsequent processing of achromatic spatial cues, possibly via surface segmentation [Perception 31 (2002) 995-1003]. Instead, we argue that the brain prioritizes chromatic information to compensate for the sluggishness of chromatic processing in early visual areas, and allow chromatic and achromatic information to reach higher-level visual areas simultaneously.

Within the group of alphabetic orthographies itself, there are varying degrees of dependence on the strict alphabetic principle: the range of correspondence between grapheme and phoneme varies both in consistency and completeness. The degree of this dependence is to some extent a function of a language's characteristic phonology and morphology, just as was the choice of the kind of orthography itself. Even among the various alphabetic writing systems themselves, there are major differences in the degree to which they mirror the phonemic structure of their respective spoken languages. The reason for the differences is largely accounted for by the particular phonological and morphological characteristics of each language. For example, standard written Hebrew is an orthography in which all diacritics (or points) are omitted. These diacritics represent nearly all of the vowels and are also used to disambiguate some of the consonants.},

Fossil evidence shows apes, and early human ancestors were fruit eaters living in environments with strongly seasonal climates. Rapid cooling at the end of the Middle Miocene (15\textendash 12 Ma: millions of years ago) increased seasonality in Africa and Europe, and ape survival may be linked with a mutation in uric acid metabolism. Climate stabilized in the later Miocene and Pliocene (12\textendash 5 Ma), and fossil apes and early hominins were both adapted for life on ground and in trees. Around 2.5 Ma, early species of Homo introduced more animal products into their diet, and this coincided with developing bipedalism, stone tool technology and increase in brain size. Early species of Homo such as Homo habilis still lived in woodland habitats, and the major habitat shift in human evolution occurred at 1.8 Ma with the origin of Homo erectus. Homo erectus had increased body size, greater hunting skills, a diet rich in meat, control of fire and understanding about cooking food, and moved from woodland to savannah. Group size may also have increased at the same time, facilitating the transmission of knowledge from one generation to the next. The earliest fossils of Homo sapiens appeared about 300 kyr, but they had separated from Neanderthals by 480 kyr or earlier. Their diet shifted towards grain-based foods about 100 kyr ago, and settled agriculture developed about 10 kyr ago. This pattern remains for many populations to this day and provides important insights into current burden of lifestyle diseases.},

In the derivational task, subjects were asked to produce nouns derived from verbs and from adjectives (e.g., to observe \textendash{} observation; kind \textendash{} kindness). After the presentation of the derived noun, they had to generate the corresponding verb (e.g., failure \textendash{} to fail: generation task). In the inflectional task, subjects had to produce the past participle of the verb or the plural form of the adjective or the derived noun. Behavioural data were collected in separate sessions in two different conditions. In the first experiment, as in the fMRI study, vocal reaction times (RTs) were measured from the offset of the auditory stimulus to the onset of the participant's response. In the second experiment, run with a different group of participants, RTs were recorded starting from the onset of the auditory stimulus to the onset of the response. The fMRI results showed that, relative to the inflectional task and to a repetition task, the derivational task, but not the verb generation task, brought about an activation of left fronto-parietal regions, documenting a specific involvement of these areas in the processing of derived words. Although less extended, similar activation was found for verb inflection but was absent for noun and adjective plural forms. Analysis of behavioral data indicated that an explanation in terms of task difficulty was unlikely related to the imaging results.},

In the repetition task, participants were asked to silently repeat the presented verb, adjective or noun. In the inflectional task, participants were asked to silently produce the past participle of verbs or the plural form of adjectives and nouns. A left fronto-parietal network was activated when comparing the noun-from-verb and noun-from-adjective derivation tasks both with the repetition and with the inflectional task. The region of activation included the ventrolateral frontal cortex, the inferior parietal lobule and the supramarginal gyrus. The intriguing result was the parietal lobe activation.

Errors represented 20\% of the responses overall. Virtually all of the children demonstrated productivity with regular (e.g., good) and irregular patterns (zero-marking, e.g., sit {$>$} sit; vowel-change, e.g., ride {$>$} rid). Overall frequency of errors decreased with age, yet the tendency for certain types of irregularizations increased in the older groups. Analyses across items indicated that all error types were predicted by combinations of item frequency, phonological characteristics of stems and past tense forms, and aspects of phonological past tense "neighborhoods." Contrary to "hybrid" or dual-mechanism models incorporating a phonologically-insensitive default mechanism (e.g., Prasada \& Pinker, 1993), these results suggest that children's productivity with regular and irregular patterns is consistent with a phonologically-based constraint satisfaction system similar to that implemented in connectionist models (Daugherly \& Seidenberg, 1992; Plunkett \& Marchmon, 1991, 1993).

  abstract = {In a recent note, Marcus (1995) suggests that the rate of overregularization of English irregular plural nouns is not substantively different from that of English irregular past tense verbs. This finding is claimed to be in conflict with the predictions of connectionist models (Plunkett \& Marchman, 1991, 1993) which are said to depend solely on the dominance of regular over irregular forms in determining overregulation errors. However, these conclusions may be premature given that Marcus averaged overregulation rates across irregular nominal forms that varied in token frequency and across samples representing a broad range of children's ages. A connectionist view would predict an interplay between type frequency and other item level factors, e.g. token frequency, as well as differences in the developmental trajectories of the acquisition of nouns and verbs. In this response, we briefly review longitudinal parental report data (N=26) which indicate that children are significantly more likely to produce noun overregularizations than verb overregularizations across a prescribed age period (1;5 to 2;6). At the same time, these data also show that children are familiar with proportionately more irregular nouns than irregular verbs. These findings are consistent with the predictions of Plunkett \& Marchman (1991, 1993) in that the larger regular class affects the frequency of noun errors but also that familiarity with individual irregular nouns tends to reduce the likelihood of overregularizations. In contrast to the conclusion of Marcus (1995), the connectionist approach to English inflectional morphology provides a plausible explanation of the phenomenon of overregularization in both the English plural and past tense systems.},

The oral reading of 7 Hebrew-speaking participants with acquired neglexia at the word level \textendash{} 6 with left neglexia and 1 with right neglexia - was evaluated. The main finding was that the morphological role of the letters on the neglected side of the word affected neglect errors: When an affix appeared on the neglected side, it was neglected significantly more often than when the neglected side was part of the root; root letters on the neglected side were never omitted, whereas affixes were. Perceptual effects of length and final letter form were found for words with an affix on the neglected side, but not for words in which a root letter appeared in the neglected side. Semantic and lexical factors did not affect the participants' reading and error pattern, and neglect errors did not preserve the morpho-lexical characteristics of the target words. These findings indicate that an early morphological decomposition of words to their root and affixes occurs before access to the lexicon and to semantics, at the orthographic-visual analysis stage, and that the effects did not result from lexical feedback. The same effects of morphological structure on reading were manifested by the participants with left- and right-sided neglexia. Since neglexia is a deficit at the orthographic-visual analysis level, the effect of morphology on reading patterns in neglexia further supports that morphological decomposition occurs in the orthographic-visual analysis stage, prelexically, and that the search for the three letters of the root in Hebrew is a trigger for attention shift in neglexia.},

Starting from this division, several studies have been carried out in order to establish possible differences in terms of psychological and physiological variables. This study is aimed at assessing the differences that might occur in electromyographic activity and temperature in long, medium and short sleep pattern subjects at two moments in the day. From a 300-subject sample, 17 long sleep pattern, nine medium sleep pattern and eight short sleep pattern subjects were selected. The physiological variables were assessed during a constant stimulation task in the morning (between 09.00 and 10.00 h) and in the evening (between 19.00 and 20.00 h). The inter-group analysis showed that the long sleep pattern and the short sleep pattern subjects differed in terms of electromyographic activity in the morning. This same analysis indicated that only long sleep pattern subjects showed changes in electromyographic activity over two measurements taken in the same day. The results point out that long sleep pattern subjects show more sensitivity towards changes, and that sensitivity is expressed in a different manner, depending on the time of the day.},

  abstract = {Children extend regular grammatical patterns to irregular words, resulting in overregularizations like comed, often after a period of correct performance ("U-shaped development"). The errors seem paradigmatic of rule use, hence bear on central issues in the psychology of rules: how creative rule application interacts with memorized exceptions in development, how overgeneral rules are unlearned in the absence of parental feedback, and whether cognitive processes involve explicit rules or parallel distributed processing (connectionist) networks. We remedy the lack of quantitative data on overregularization by analyzing 11,521 irregular past tense utterances in the spontaneous speech of 83 children. Our findings are as follows. (1) Overregularization errors are relatively rare (median 2.5\% of irregular past tense forms), suggesting that there is no qualitative defect in children's grammars that must be unlearned. (2) Overregularization occurs at a roughly constant low rate from the 2s into the school-age years, affecting most irregular verbs. (3) Although overregularization errors never predominate, one aspect of their purported U-shaped development was confirmed quantitatively: an extended period of correct performance precedes the first error. (4) Overregularization does not correlate with increases in the number or proportion of regular verbs in parental speech, children's speech, or children's vocabularies. Thus, the traditional account in which memory operates before rules cannot be replaced by a connectionist alternative in which a single network displays rotelike or rulelike behavior in response to changes in input statistics. (5) Overregularizations first appear when children begin to mark regular verbs for tense reliably (i. e., when they stop saying Yesterday I walk). (6) The more often a parent uses an irregular form, the less often the child overregularizes it. (7) Verbs are protected from overregularization by similar-sounding irregulars, but they are not attracted to overregularization by similar-sounding regulars, suggesting that irregular patterns are stored in an associative memory with connectionist properties, but that regulars are not. We propose a simple explanation. Children, like adults, mark tense using memory (for irregulars) and an affixation rule that can generate a regular past tense form for any verb. Retrieval of an irregular blocks the rule, but children's memory traces are not strong enough to guarantee perfect retrieval. When retrieval fails, the rule is applied, and overregularization results.},

  abstract = {The present work proposes a computational model of morpheme combination at the meaning level. The model moves from the tenets of distributional semantics, and assumes that word meanings can be effectively represented by vectors recording their co-occurrence with other words in a large text corpus. Given this assumption, affixes are modeled as functions (matrices) mapping stems onto derived forms. Derived-form meanings can be thought of as the result of a combinatorial procedure that transforms the stem vector on the basis of the affix matrix (e.g., the meaning of nameless is obtained by multiplying the vector of name with the matrix of -less). We show that this architecture accounts for the remarkable human capacity of generating new words that denote novel meanings, correctly predicting semantic intuitions about novel derived forms. Moreover, the proposed compositional approach, once paired with a whole-word route, provides a new interpretative framework for semantic transparency, which is here partially explained in terms of ease of the combinatorial procedure and strength of the transformation brought about by the affix. Model-based predictions are in line with the modulation of semantic transparency on explicit intuitions about existing words, response times in lexical decision, and morphological priming. In conclusion, we introduce a computational model to account for morpheme combination at the meaning level. The model is data-driven, theoretically sound, and empirically supported, and it makes predictions that open new research avenues in the domain of semantic processing.},

In the first experiment, we present streams of speech in which precisely the same kinds of syllable regularities occur as in our previous studies, except that the patterned relations among syllables occur between non-adjacent syllables (with an intervening syllable that is unrelated). Under these circumstances we do not obtain our previous results: learners are quite poor at acquiring regular relations among non-adjacent syllables, even when the patterns are objectively quite simple. In subsequent experiments we show that learners are, in contrast, quite capable of acquiring patterned relations among non-adjacent segments\textemdash both non-adjacent consonants (with an intervening vocalic segment that is unrelated) and non-adjacent vowels (with an intervening consonantal segment that is unrelated). Finally, we discuss why human learners display these strong differences in learning differing types of non-adjacent regularities, and we conclude by suggesting that these contrasts in learnability may account for why human languages display non-adjacent regularities of one type much more widely than non-adjacent regularities of the other type.},

  author = {Marin, Joseph W.},
  year = {1997},
  abstract = {A sentence-pair repetition procedure was used to examine how inflected and derived words are represented during speech planning. Three experiments tested the hypotheses that inflectional structure is represented in syntactic plans for speech, and that derivational structure is not, as assumed by speech production theories. Participants performed aloud repetitions of pairs of sentences that matched in all structural aspects (Congruent) or differed in the morphological affixation of one critical word (Incongruent). In the Syntactically Engaged condition, the critical words filled their usual syntactic roles. In the Syntactically Disengaged condition, the critical words were merely cited (e.g., Say walked first.), so they should not affect the syntactic plan. Production theories predict that repetition of sentences with incongruent inflections should be more difficult than repetition of sentences with congruent inflections, especially in the Syntactically Engaged condition. For derivational morphology, the theories stipulate no syntactic engagement of affixes, but a separate phonological competition process may produce a general congruence cost for these materials. Experiment 1 studied inflectional morphology using a discrete repetition task, in which participants performed isolated repetitions of sentence pairs. Production durations showed an effect of Congruence but no interaction with Syntactic Engagement, suggesting that the task may be insufficiently sensitive to syntactic planning processes. Accordingly, Experiments 2 and 3 adopted the continuous repetition procedure employed in previous production planning research to examine inflectional and derivational morphology, respectively. Overall, results confirmed predictions and supported the hypotheses that inflectional structure is represented in syntactic plans, and that derivational structure is not. In addition, the experiments demonstrate that the continuous repetition task can be applied successfully to study syntactic and morphological planning, opening the door for experiments addressing finer details of the processes.

It indicates that science's normativity \textendash{} which answers the question ``what should science do?'' \textendash{} orients itself in relation to the a priori potential of society.

Adorno's Gesamtgesehen, which differentiates from any total and, therefore, totalitarian conception of what science is, along with Horkheimer's dialectical approach to science through interdisciplinarity and Habermas' notion of communicative rationality (that emphasizes scientific dialogue) in science, finds themselves in marked contrast to the rest of modern epistemology. The chapter traces the epistemology of critical theory of the Frankfurt School through the twentieth and the twenty-first centuries via the concepts of dialectics, critique, reason, interdisciplinarity, communicative action and rationality, and their social and political function and role within modernity. The main aims of twenty-first-century epistemology of critical theory become as follows: formulate a theory of normative rationality, reclaim commitments to rational praxis, and educate the sciences to maintain dialectics as their pivotal scope and method of advance.},

BootLex, a new model which uses distributional cues to build a lexicon, demonstrates how much can be accomplished using this single source of information. This conceptually simple probabilistic algorithm achieves significant segmentation results on various kinds of language corpora \textendash{} English, Japanese, and Spanish; child- and adult-directed speech, and written texts; and several variations in coding structure \textendash{} and reveals which statistical characteristics of the input have an influence on segmentation performance. BootLex is then compared, quantitatively and qualitatively, with three other groups of computational models of the same infant segmentation process, paying particular attention to functional characteristics of the models and their similarity to human cognition. Commonalities and contrasts among the models are discussed, as well as their implications both for theories of the cognitive problem of segmentation itself, and for the general enterprise of computational cognitive modeling.},

Nonparametric statistical tests offer complete freedom to the user with respect to the test statistic by means of which the experimental conditions are compared. This freedom provides a straightforward way to solve the multiple comparisons problem (MCP) and it allows to incorporate biophysically motivated constraints in the test statistic, which may drastically increase the sensitivity of the statistical test. The paper is written for two audiences: (1) empirical neuroscientists looking for the most appropriate data analysis method, and (2) methodologists interested in the theoretical concepts behind nonparametric statistical tests. For the empirical neuroscientist, a large part of the paper is written in a tutorial-like fashion, enabling neuroscientists to construct their own statistical test, maximizing the sensitivity to the expected effect. And for the methodologist, it is explained why the nonparametric test is formally correct. This means that we formulate a null hypothesis (identical probability distribution in the different experimental conditions) and show that the nonparametric test controls the false alarm rate under this null hypothesis.},

We present data concerning a phenomenon that has not been considered by either model\textendash regular past tense verbs with contrasting phonotactics. One set of verbs contains clusters at the inflected verb end that also occur in monomorphemic words ('monomorphemically legal clusters', MLC) whereas the other has clusters that can only occur in inflected forms ('monomorphemically illegal clusters',MIC). We argue that if children apply a morphological rule, phonotactics will not affect performance. Conversely, if children store past tense forms, they will perform better on verbs with MLCs because these clusters are more frequent. We investigated three populations\textendash typically developing children, Grammatical-SLI (G-SLI) andWilliams Syndrome(WS)\textendash using past tense elicitation tasks. In Experiment 1we reanalyse data fromvan der Lely and Ullman [van der Lely, H.K. J.\& Ullman,M. (2001). Past tensemorphology in specifically language impaired and normally developing children. Language and Cognitive Processes, 16: 177-217] and show that G-SLI children perform better on MLC verbs, whereas for typically developing children phonotactics do not affect performance. In Experiment 2 we replicate these findings in new groups of G-SLI and typically developing children. In Experiment 3 we reanalyse data from Thomas et al. [Thomas,M. S.

Is this regularization due to a semantic difference from the usual verb, or is it due to the application of the default rule, namely VERB + -ed suffix? In Experiment 1, participants rated the semantic similarity of the extended senses of polysemous verbs and denominal verbs to their central senses. Experiment 2 examined the acceptability of the regular and irregular past-tenses of the different verbs. The results showed that all the denominal verbs were rated as more acceptable for the regular inflection than the same verbs used polysemously, even though the two were semantically equally similar to the central meaning. Thus, the derivation of the verb (nominal or verbal) determined the past-tense preference more than semantic variables, consistent with dual-route models of verb inflection.},

With the subthreshold motion, activity in the visual cortex measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging was higher, but activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex was lower, than with suprathreshold motion.

No effects of orthographic relatedness were found at any SOA. Semantic relatedness did not interact with effects of morphological decomposability, which came through strongly at all SOAs, even for pseudo-suffixed pairs such as archer-arch. Derivational morphological effects in masked priming seem to be primarily driven by morphological decomposability at an early stage of visual word recognition, and are independent of semantic factors. A second experiment reversed the order of prime and target (stem-derived rather than derived-stem), and again found that morphological priming did not interact with semantic relatedness. This points to an early segmentation process that is driven by morphological decomposability and not by the structure or content of central lexical representations.},

There was clear evidence for morphological decomposition of semantically transparent forms. This was independent of phonological transparency, suggesting that morphemic representations are phonologically abstract. Semantically opaque forms, in contrast, behave like monomorphemic words.

According to the Graded Salience Hypothesis (GSH, Giora, 1997, Giora, 2002, Giora, 2003), which predicts a selective RH involvement in the processing of novel, nonsalient meanings, it is primarily the degree of meaning salience of a linguistic expression rather than literality or nonliterality, which modulates the degree of left hemisphere (LH) and right hemisphere (RH) processing of metaphors. In the present study, novel metaphorical expressions represented the nonsalient interpretations, whereas conventional metaphors and literal expressions represented the salient interpretations. A direct comparison of the novel metaphors vs. the conventional metaphors revealed significantly stronger activity in right posterior superior temporal sulcus, right inferior frontal gyrus, and left middle frontal gyrus. These results support the GSH and suggest a special role for the RH in processing novel metaphors. Furthermore, the right PSTS may be selectively involved in verbal creativity.},

Because of the formal equivalence between recursion and non-recursive iteration; recursion, in the technical sense, is never a necessary component of a generative grammar. Contrary to some assertions this equivalence extends to both center-embedded relative clauses and hierarchical parse trees. Inspection of language usage suggests that recursive rule components in fact contribute very little, and likely nothing significant, to linguistic creativity. Further than this, if the productivity of human language is considered as not rigidly bound, but not infinite, then the need for any sort of iteration in generative grammars vanishes and can be replaced with a Non-iterative Explicit Alternatives Rule grammar. The knock-on effects of dispensing with recursive (or any iterative) grammar components are: that language diversity can simply be based on rule and lexicon combinatorics with no potentially infinite dimensions derived from recursive or iterative components of rules; the oddity of a vast, multiply-infinite competence set of `grammatical but unacceptable' productions is gone; and the development of a language faculty based on rules that eschew iterative rule components avoids any need for explaining `special' mechanisms. On the broader front of searching for the mechanisms of mind, our analysis can be similarly applied to the proposals for a recursive basis for mind as an explanation for humanity's great leap forward.},

  abstract = {There has been substantial progress over the last several years in understanding aspects of the functional neuroanatomy of language. Some of these advances are summarized in this review. It will be argued that recognizing speech sounds is carried out in the superior temporal lobe bilaterally, that the superior temporal sulcus bilaterally is involved in phonological-level aspects of this process, that the frontal/motor system is not central to speech recognition although it may modulate auditory perception of speech, that conceptual access mechanisms are likely located in the lateral posterior temporal lobe (middle and inferior temporal gyri), that speech production involves sensory-related systems in the posterior superior temporal lobe in the left hemisphere, that the interface between perceptual and motor systems is supported by a sensory-motor circuit for vocal tract actions (not dedicated to speech) that is very similar to sensory-motor circuits found in primate parietal lobe, and that verbal short-term memory can be understood as an emergent property of this sensory-motor circuit. These observations are considered within the context of a dual stream model of speech processing in which one pathway supports speech comprehension and the other supports sensory-motor integration. Additional topics of discussion include the functional organization of the planum temporale for spatial hearing and speech-related sensory-motor processes, the anatomical and functional basis of a form of acquired language disorder, conduction aphasia, the neural basis of vocabulary development, and sentence-level/grammatical processing.},

This edited volume asks whether the development of theory of mind (ToM) depends in any critical way on language. Nelson begins by cautioning that ToM cannot be narrowly construed as an encapsulated cognitive domain. She thus proposes to replace the 'theory' of mind metaphor with the concept of a COMMUNITY OF MINDS. Dunn \& Brophy emphasize the communicational function. Their argument is that conversational exchanges are the main channel through which we discover other minds and our own. Harris calls on the role of dyadic relations to explain a series of correlation and training studies that suggest conversation addressed to children develops their understanding of mind. Turning to the theme of semantic development, Montgomery is concerned with how children learn the meaning of mental terms. Baldwin \& Saylor argue that it is the very use of mental terms, and language more generally, that promotes the abstraction of mental concepts. The final chapter introduces a new method for looking at theory of mind, that of the twin study. The greatest achievement of this book is the consensus it has formed that ToM and language are interconnected on several levels. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

In Semitic languages like Arabic, however, linguistic analysis proposes that one of the three component morphemes of a surface word is the CV-Skeleton, an abstract prosodic unit coding the phonological shape of the surface word and its primary syntactic function, which has no surface phonetic content (McCarthy, J. J. (1981). A prosodic theory of non-concatenative morphology, Linguistic Inquiry, 12 373\textendash 418). The other two morphemes are proposed to be the vocalic melody, which conveys additional syntactic information, and the root, which defines meaning. In three experiments using masked, cross-modal, and auditory\textendash auditory priming we examined the role of the vocalic melody and the CV-Skeleton as potential morphemic units in the processing and representation of Arabic words. Prime/target pairs sharing the vocalic melody but not the CV-Skeleton consistently failed to prime. In contrast, word pairs sharing only the CV-Skeleton primed reliably throughout, with the amount of priming being as large as that observed between word pattern pairs sharing both vocalic melody and CV-Skeleton. Priming between morphologically related words can be observed when there is no overlap either in meaning or in surface phonetic form.},

Although LMMs have many advantages over ANOVA, like ANOVAs, setting them up for data analysis also requires some care. One simple option, when numerically possible, is to fit the full variance-covariance structure of random effects (the maximal model; Barr, Levy, Scheepers \& Tily, 2013), presumably to keep Type I error down to the nominal {$\alpha$} in the presence of random effects. Although it is true that fitting a model with only random intercepts may lead to higher Type I error, fitting a maximal model also has a cost: it can lead to a significant loss of power. We demonstrate this with simulations and suggest that for typical psychological and psycholinguistic data, higher power is achieved without inflating Type I error rate if a model selection criterion is used to select a random effect structure that is supported by the data.},

Despite the importance of emotion, the relative lack of objective methodologies to scientifically studying emotional phenomena limits our current understanding and thereby calls for the development of novel methodologies, such us the study of illustrative animal models. Analysis of Drosophila and other insects has unlocked new opportunities to elucidate the behavioral phenotypes of fundamentally emotional phenomena. Here we propose an integrative model of basic emotions based on observations of this animal model. The basic emotions are internal states that are modulated by neuromodulators, and these internal states are externally expressed as certain stereotypical behaviors, such as instinct, which is proposed as ancient mechanisms of survival. There are four kinds of basic emotions: happiness, sadness, fear, and anger, which are differentially associated with three core affects: reward (happiness), punishment (sadness), and stress (fear and anger). These core affects are analogous to the three primary colors (red, yellow, and blue) in that they are combined in various proportions to result in more complex ``higher order'' emotions, such as love and aesthetic emotion. We refer to our proposed model of emotions as called the ``Three Primary Color Model of Basic Emotions.''},

In Experiment 1, RTs to affixed derived words of medium and low surface frequency were studied as a function of their cumulative root frequency. Results show that cumulative root frequency determines the latencies to suffixed words but not to prefixed words. In Experiment 2, it was shown that RTs to derived suffixed words belonging to the same morphological family (i.e., words sharing a same root) vary as a function of their relative whole word frequency. The asymmetry in the role of cumulative root frequency for prefixed and suffixed words is interpreted with reference to the different sequential morphological organization of these two types of words (Affix + Root) versus (Root + Affix). It is proposed that only suffixed words are accessed via the root. In the recognition of these words access to the root implies access to the corresponding morphological family. The members of the family are then examined in a frequency-ordered search.},

Pinker and Ullman defended the theory that irregular past-tense forms are stored in the lexicon, a division of declarative memory, whereas regular forms can be computed by a concatenation rule, which requires the procedural system. McClelland and Patterson commented on their article, presenting evidence to support a three modal connectionist account, a gradual acquisition of the past tense, graded sensitivity to phonological and semantic content and a single mechanism for regular and irregular forms. Marslen-Wilson and Tyler did not believe the McClelland and Patterson connectionist models to represent a promising direction, either for resolving the past-tense disputer, or for capturing the specific functional and neural architecture of the human language system. The current authors reply to this criticism, stating the arguments given in their comment do not refute their view.

ERPLAB's tools can be accessed either from an easy-to-learn graphical user interface or from MATLAB scripts, and a command history function makes it easy for users with no programming experience to write scripts. Consequently, ERPLAB provides both ease of use and virtually unlimited power and flexibility, making it appropriate for the analysis of both simple and complex ERP experiments.

The article is in part an historical review and in part a tutorial, reviewing the probabilistic Bayesian approach to understanding perception and how it may be shaped by context, and also reviewing ideas about how such probabilistic computations may be carried out in neural networks, focusing on the role of context in interactive neural networks, in which both bottom-up and top-down signals affect the interpretation of sensory inputs. It is pointed out that connectionist units that use the logistic or softmax activation functions can exactly compute Bayesian posterior probabilities when the bias terms and connection weights affecting such units are set to the logarithms of appropriate probabilistic quantities. Bayesian concepts such the prior, likelihood, (joint and marginal) posterior, probability matching and maximizing, and calculating vs. sampling from the posterior are all reviewed and linked to neural network computations. Probabilistic and neural network models are explicitly linked to the concept of a probabilistic generative model that describes the relationship between the underlying target of perception (e.g., the word intended by a speaker or other source of sensory stimuli) and the sensory input that reaches the perceiver for use in inferring the underlying target. It is shown how a new version of the IA model called the multinomial interactive activation (MIA) model can sample correctly from the joint posterior of a proposed generative model for perception of letters in words, indicating that interactive processing is fully consistent with principled probabilistic computation. Ways in which these computations might be realized in real neural systems are also considered.},

A visual input excites detectors for visual features in the display and for letters consistent with the active features. Letter detectors in turn excite detectors for consistent words. It is suggested that active word detectors mutually inhibit each other and send feedback to the letter level, strengthening activation and hence perceptibility of their constituent letters. Computer simulation of the model exhibits the perceptual advantage for letters in words over unrelated contexts and is considered consistent with basic facts about word advantage. Most important, the model produces facilitation for letters in pronounceable pseudowords as well as words. Pseudowords activate detectors for words that are consistent with most active letters, and feedback from the activated words strengthens activations of the letters in the pseudoword. The model thus accounts for apparently rule-governed performance without any actual rules. (50 ref)},

Ullman (see record 2002-08093-004) which proposed two mechanisms--a rule system and a lexical memory--to form past tenses and other inflections. It is noted that this proposal predicts that children's acquisition of the regular inflection is sudden; that the regular inflection applies uniformly regardless of phonological, semantic or other factors; and that the rule system is separably vulnerable to disruption. A connectionist account makes the opposite predictions. The current authors present evidence to support all three connectionist predictions: gradual acquisition of the past tense inflection; graded sensitivity to phonological and semantic content; and a single, integrated mechanism for regular and irregular forms, dependent jointly on phonology and semantics.

When measured against unrelated control primes effects of morphological relatedness interacted with level of form overlap. When measured against form-related controls, morphological priming no longer interacted with level of form overlap. This suggests that masked morphological priming is relatively independent of form relatedness per se, and that abstract, form-independent morphemic representations are at play.

The current authors present a different approach in which an integrated connectionist network maps from the stems of all verbs to their past-tense forms, using a single network of units and connections. It is argued that nearly all exceptional past-tenses in English are quasi-regular to some extent, and the Pinker-Ullman theory provides no mechanisms for exploiting the aspects of the regular past tense that are so prevalent among exceptions.

The research presented here asks whether this morpho-orthographic segmentation process breaks down for derived stimuli that cannot be segmented perfectly into their morphemic components. Three masked priming experiments are presented that demonstrate that morpho-orthographic segmentation is robust to a series of common orthographic alterations found in complex words, including (a) missing 'e' (e.g., adorable--ADORE), (b) shared 'e' (e.g., lover--LOVE), and (c) duplicated consonant (e.g., dropper--DROP). Our fourth experiment demonstrates that this robustness to orthographic disruption is preserved even in the absence of a semantic relationship between prime and target (e.g., committee--COMMIT; badger--BADGE; fetish--FETE). Results are discussed in terms of the nature of the orthographic representations used in skilled reading. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

So far, this claim has been tested only with respect to low-frequency primes and non word primes. This is a limitation because some models of morphological processing postulate that only high-frequency complex words are recognized as whole forms. Thus, a more stringent test would be to determine whether high-frequency complex words also show evidence of masked priming. We report an experiment that compares masked-priming effects observed when the primes constitute morphologically structured non words (e.g., alarmer,\"A\`iALARM), low-frequency words with a mean frequency of 2 per million (e.g., notional,\"A\`iNOTION), and high-frequency words with a mean frequency of 60 per million (e.g., national,\"A\`iNATION). These three conditions yielded significant and equivalent effects, lending strong support to the notion of a routine form of decomposition that is applied to all morphologically structured stimuli.

However, the answers CMT theorists have offered are typically unsubstantiated by the empirical evidence, and occasionally unfalsifiable. This reply to Raymond W. Gibbs Jr.'s positive evaluation of the theory offers an alternative assessment that is more critical of its shortcomings. This critique summarizes four basic problems with CMT: The theory (a) is attributionally ambiguous about the locus of metaphoric motivation, (b) commits a form of the infamous "homunculus problem" in philosophy of mind, (c) employs circular reasoning to formulate hypotheses and interpret linguistic evidence, and (d) is not parsimonious. All of these problems are evident in Gibbs's piece, and thereby undermine his defense of CMT's explanatory value. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Normal controls (n = 21), subjects with lesions in the ventromedial (VM) (n = 9) or dorsolateral/high mesial (DL/M) prefrontal cortices (n = 10), performed on (1) modified delay tasks that assess working memory and (2) a gambling task designed to measure decision making. VM subjects with more anterior lesions (n = 4) performed defectively on the gambling but not the delay task. VM subjects with more posterior lesions (n = 5) were impaired on both tasks.Right DL/M subjects were impaired on the delay task but not the gambling task. Left DL/M subjects were not impaired on either task. The findings reveal a cognitive and anatomic double dissociation between deficits in decision making (anterior VM) and working memory (right DL/M). This presents the first direct evidence of such effects in humans using the lesion method and underscores the special importance of the VM prefrontal region in decision making, independent of a direct role in working memory.},

Experiments 1-3 examined the question of whether words are decomposed into constituent morphemes during recognition. Nonwords which contained morphological structure (e.g., *confusal (Exp. 1), *detrude Exp. 2)) failed to elicit an enhanced N400 component. The finding was especially surprising for the morphological nonwords used in Experiment 2, which were entirely meaningless. This was taken in support of a model of word recognition in which exploits morphological structure. Experiments 4-7 examined the question of whether the brain's response to violations of morphological constraints resembles the response to syntactic violations (P600). No such effect was observed. Rather, a reduction in the amplitude of the P200 component consistently co-occurred with the presentation morphological violations. The possibility that the P200 may serve as a reliable indicator of morphological anomaly is discussed. The existence of a specific ERP effect for morphological violations is also taken to support the notion that morphological structure is accessed during word recognition.

Individual factors, such as intolerance of uncertainty, may impact risk for ED pathology and CE in response to COVID-19 anxiety. The current study examined associations between COVID-19 anxiety, trait intolerance of uncertainty, and COVID-19 intolerance of uncertainty and ED pathology and compulsive exercise. Method: Undergraduate participants (N = 295) completed a series of online questionnaires between March and April of 2020. Results: COVID-19 anxiety and intolerance of uncertainty were associated with ED pathology, but not compulsive exercise. Additionally, both trait and COVID-19 intolerance of uncertainty moderated associations between COVID-19 anxiety and compulsive exercise and ED pathology. COVID-19 anxiety was more strongly related to compulsive exercise and ED pathology for individuals with lower intolerance of uncertainty. Discussion: COVID-19 anxiety may increase risk for ED pathology and may be specifically important in determining risk for ED pathology and compulsive exercise among individuals with lower intolerance of uncertainty. These results contribute to a growing body of research aimed at understanding the mental health consequences of the COVID-19 and suggest that individual factors (e.g., anxiety and intolerance of uncertainty) are important in determining risk for ED pathology and compulsive exercise in the context of the pandemic.

It is difficult to evaluate, however, because most available data come from large-scale, industrialized, urban populations. Here, we report the results for 12 populations with very diverse levels of economic development. Surprisingly, preferences for exaggerated sex-specific traits are only found in the novel, highly developed environments. Similarly, perceptions that masculine males look aggressive increase strongly with development and, specifically, urbanization. These data challenge the hypothesis that facial dimorphism was an important ancestral signal of heritable mate value. One possibility is that highly developed environments provide novel opportunities to discern relationships between facial traits and behavior by exposing individuals to large numbers of unfamiliar faces, revealing patterns too subtle to detect with smaller samples.},

  abstract = {Studies on small sample properties of multilevel models have become increasingly prominent in the methodological literature in response to the frequency with which small sample data appear in empirical studies. Simulation results generally recommend that empirical researchers employ restricted maximum likelihood estimation (REML) with a Kenward-Roger correction with small samples in frequentist contexts to minimize small sample bias in estimation and to prevent inflation of Type-I error rates. However, simulation studies focus on recommendations for best practice, and there is little to no explanation of why traditional maximum likelihood (ML) breaks down with smaller samples, what differentiates REML from ML, or how the Kenward-Roger correction remedies lingering small sample issues. Due to the complexity of these methods, most extant descriptions are highly mathematical and are intended to prove that the methods improve small sample performance as intended. Thus, empirical researchers have documentation that these methods are advantageous but still lack resources to help understand what the methods actually do and why they are needed. This tutorial explains why ML falters with small samples, how REML circumvents some issues, and how Kenward-Roger works. We do so without equations or derivations to support more widespread understanding and use of these valuable methods.},

We previously analyzed five ELNs and performed two survey-based studies to implement an ELN in a biomedical research institute. Among the ELNs tested, we found that Microsoft OneNote presents numerous features related to ELN best functionalities. In addition, both surveyed groups preferred OneNote over a scientifically designed ELN (PerkinElmer Elements).

We therefore provide a quick guide to adapt OneNote to an ELN workflow that can also be adjusted to other nonscientific ELNs.},

The peak latency of this negative-going response occurred between 270 and 300 msec after the onset of the terminal word. The independence of this response (the phonological mismatch negativity, PMN) from the ERP component known to be sensitive to semantic violations (N400) was demonstrated by manipulating sentence endings so that phonemic and semantic violations occurred together or separately. Four conditions used sentences that ended with (1) the highest Cloze probability word (e.g., ``The piano was out of tune.''), (2) a word having the same initial phoneme of the highest Cloze probability word but that was, in fact, semantically anomalous (e.g., ``The gambler had a streak of bad luggage.''), (3) a word having an initial phoneme different from that of the highest Cloze probability word but that was, in fact, semantically appropriate (e.g., ``Don caught the ball with his glove.''), or (4) a word that was semantically anomalous and, therefore, had an initial phoneme that was totally unexpected given the sentence's context (e.g., ``The dog chased our cat up the queen''). Neither the PMN nor the N400 was found in the first condition. Only an N400 was observed in the second condition while only a PMN was seen in the third. Both responses were elicited in the last condition. Finally, a delayed N400 occurred to semantic violations in the second condition where the initial phoneme was identical to that of the highest Cloze probability ending.

In processing, the evidence is stronger for decomposition of inflectional than derivational forms during lexical access. We argue that performance factors, such as order of occurrence, transparency, productivity and frequency of occurrence, are what determine both the representation and processing of morphological information.}

Participants read Dutch sentences containing subject\textendash verb number agreement errors while their brainwaves were measured. The determiner of the singular head noun could be ambiguous or unambiguous in number and the modifier (``local'') noun could be plural or singular. Both ambiguity and number match affect error rates in production. We expected evoked potentials in response to the verb to be modulated by number ambiguity; larger effects were expected when the sentences started with an unambiguous determiner. When the local noun was singular, we observed a more negative wave elicited by the incorrect verbs compared to the correct verbs in the 350\textendash 400~ms time-window. This effect was largest when the head noun phrase contained no number ambiguity. When the local noun was plural the waves were more positive for incorrect verbs than for correct verbs in the 600\textendash 650~ms time-window. Again this effect was largest when the head noun phrase contained no number ambiguity. Most importantly, the results show that agreement computation in comprehension is influenced by the same factors as in production. We further suggest that in the sentences with a singular local noun there is a shallow analysis of the sentence, but the sentences with a plural local noun require a deeper syntactic analysis.},

However, phonemes in word-internal positions were less likely to interact with each other than with word onsets. Results indicate that word onsets are particularly error-prone and therefore often interact with each other, but are also very likely to engage in interactions with phonemes in other positions if the elicitation technique encourages these interactions. Exp 3 with 13 undergraduates, aimed to create speech errors in which consonants and vowels interacted.

Areas that are particularly affected are the frontal lobes, which are involved in reasoning, judgment, and problem solving. Older people are especially vulnerable to the damaging effects of alcohol. It is unclear whether women show consistently more vulnerability to these changes in the brain than men do. In general, alcoholics evaluated before and after a period of abstinence show some recovery of tissue volume, whereas alcoholics evaluated again after continued drinking show further reductions in brain tissue volume. A new MR technique called diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can aid in detecting the degradation of fibers (i.e., white matter) that carry information between brain cells (i.e., gray matter). With DTI, researchers studying alcoholics have been able to detect abnormalities in white matter not visible with conventional MRI. Ultimately DTI may be useful in elucidating the mechanisms that underlie macrostructural and functional brain changes seen with abstinence and relapse.},

In the present study, we use a unique approach to evaluate the adaptive significance of trichromacy for fruit detection by undertaking a functional substitution model. The color vision phenotypes of neotropical monkeys are simulated for human observers, who use a touch-sensitive computer interface to search for monkey food items in digital images taken under natural conditions. We find an advantage to trichromatic phenotypes\textemdash especially the variant with the most spectrally separated visual pigments\textemdash for red, yellow and greenish fruits, but not for dark (purple or black) fruits. These results indicate that trichromat advantage is task-specific, and that shape, size and achromatic contrast variation between ripe and unripe fruits cannot completely mitigate the advantage of color vision. Similarities in fruit foraging performance between primates with different phenotypes in the wild likely reflect the behavioral flexibility of dichromats in overcoming a chromatic disadvantage.

In 2009, ambitions for open-access data sharing were revived in the resting state functional MRI community in the form of two grassroots initiatives: the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project (FCP) and its successor, the International Neuroimaging Datasharing Initiative (INDI). Beyond providing open access to thousands of clinical and non-clinical imaging datasets, the FCP and INDI have demonstrated the feasibility of large-scale data aggregation for hypothesis generation and testing. Yet, the success of the FCP and INDI should not be confused with widespread embracement of open-access data sharing. Reminiscent of the challenges faced by fMRIDC, key controversies persist and include participant privacy, the role of informatics, and the logistical and cultural challenges of establishing an open science ethos. We discuss the FCP and INDI in the context of these challenges, highlighting the promise of current initiatives and suggesting solutions for possible pitfalls.},

Experiment 2 investigated the role of long-term consolidation on affix acquisition by comparing knowledge of learned affixes two days and nearly two months after training. Results demonstrated that episodic knowledge of affixes can be acquired shortly after a single training session using either form or semantic learning, but suggested that the development of lexicalized representations of affixes requires the provision of semantic information during learning as well as a substantial period of offline consolidation.

  abstract = {Investigated the lexical representation of morphologically complex words in French using a cross-modal priming experiment. The authors asked if the lexical representation for derivationally suffixed and prefixed words is morphologically structured and how this relates to the phonological transparency of the surface relationship between stem and affix. 38 Ss (aged 18-30 yrs) participated in this study. A clear effect of the morphological structure for derived words was observed. Prefixed words prime their stems, even when they have a phonologically opaque relationship, and a prefixed word primes another prefixed word derived from the same stem. However, suffixed words prime their stems only if their relationship is phonologically transparent. Two suffixed words derived from the same stem prime each other. These two latter results differ from those observed in English by W. D. Marslen-Wilson, L. K. Tyler, R. Waksler, and L. Older (1994). It is argued that it is the specific properties of the language, such as rhythm, that could explain the differences between the results observed for the two languages. The authors propose a model where prefixed and suffixed words are decomposed at different stages during their identification process. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2002 APA, all rights reserved).},

Using a voxel-by-voxel morphometric technique, we found gray matter volume differences in motor, auditory, and visual-spatial brain regions when comparing professional musicians (keyboard players) with a matched group of amateur musicians and non-musicians. Although some of these multiregional differences could be attributable to innate predisposition, we believe they may represent structural adaptations in response to long-term skill acquisition and the repetitive rehearsal of those skills. This hypothesis is supported by the strong association we found between structural differences, musician status, and practice intensity, as well as the wealth of supporting animal data showing structural changes in response to long-term motor training. However, only future experiments can determine the relative contribution of predisposition and practice.},

The proposed theory views NP anaphor processing as an optimization process that is based on the principle that processing cost, defined in terms of activating semantic information, should serve some discourse function\textemdash identifying the antecedent, adding new information, or both. In a series of 5 self-paced reading experiments, anaphors' functionality was manipulated by changing the discourse focus, and their cost was manipulated by changing the semantic relation between the anaphors and their antecedents. The results show that reading times of NP anaphors reflect their functional justification: Anaphors were read faster when their cost had a better functional justification. These results are incompatible with any theory that treats NP anaphors as one homogeneous class regardless of discourse function and processing cost.

In Experiment 1, we used as primes pseudowords consisting of a non-interpretable combination of roots and suffixes, such as \textdegree sportation, formed by the noun sport "sport" and the suffix -ation. In Experiment 2, primes were semantically interpretable pseudowords made of the combination of a root and a suffix, such as \textdegree rapidifier "to quickify". In Experiment 3, we used as primes semantically interpretable pseudowords that were designed to be synonymous with existing derived words, for example \textdegree cuisineur, which, if it existed, would mean the same as cuisinier "a cook". Finally, in Experiment 4, we used as primes non-morphological pseudowords like \textdegree rapiduit, -uit being an existing ending of French but not a suffix. The results of the four experiments show that priming only occurs with those morphologically complex pseudowords which are interpretable (including those which are synonymous with a pre-existing derived form), providing evidence that semantic factors are taken into account when the prime is overtly presented. Our results further support the view that morphological effects come into play at at least two processing stages, a morphological decomposition based on formal properties and a semantic integration based on semantic compatibility between morphemes.

Naming latencies for CWs and control words were equivalent in a delayed NT.

He could perform individual finger movements and outline figures in the air with his eyes closed. He had normal pre- and postmovement EEG potentials, and showed the normal bi/triphasic pattern of muscle activation in agonist and antagonist muscles during fast limb movements. He could also move his thumb accurately through three different distances at three different speeds, and could produce three different levels of force at his thumb pad when required. Although he could not judge the weights of objects placed in his hands without vision, he was able to match forces applied by the experimenter to the pad of each thumb if he was given a minimal indication of thumb movement.Despite his success with these laboratory tasks, his hands were relatively useless to him in daily life. He was unable to grasp a pen and write, to fasten his shirt buttons or to hold a cup in one hand. Part of his difficulty lay in the absence of any automatic reflex correction in his voluntary movements, and also to an inability to sustain constant levels of muscle contraction without visual feedback over periods of more than one or two seconds. He was also unable to maintain long sequences of simple motor programmes without vision.},

  abstract = {Can regular and irregular verb forms be accommodated by a single representational mechanism or is a dual mechanism account required? In a first experiment, we used a cross-modal repetition priming paradigm to investigate the mental representation of regular and irregular verb forms in French. Participants heard a spoken prime (such as aimons, 'we love') immediately followed by lexical decision to a visual probe (such as aimer, 'to love'). We contrasted four types of French verbs, varying in the regularity and degree of allomorphy of their verb form inflection. These were (i) fully regular verbs (aimons/aimer, 'we love/to love') (ii) regular verbs that undergo minor and phonologically predictable allomorphic changes (sement/semer, 'they sow/to sow') (iii) irregular verbs exhibiting subregularities (pelgnent/ peindre, 'they paint/to paint') and (iv) irregular verbs with idiosyncratic alternations (vont/aller, 'they go/to go'). The infinitive forms of these verbs were presented as targets in three prime conditions, preceded either by a regular form, an allomorphic form (except for the fuller regular verbs), or an unrelated prime. Morphologically related primes significantly facilitated lexical decision responses for all four verb classes, irrespective of regularity and allomorphy. The same pattern of results was observed in a second experiment using a masked priming paradigm. These results contrasted with English, where regularly inflected verbs prime their stems but irregular verbs do not. We argue that this reflects cross-linguistic differences in the morphophonological decomposability of French irregular forms, and that the current results enable us to deconfound regularity/irregularity distinctions from language-specific morphophonological differences.

  abstract = {Most electrophysiology studies analyze the activity of each neuron separately. While such studies have given much insight into properties of the visual system, they have also potentially overlooked important aspects of information coded in changing patterns of activity that are distributed over larger populations of neurons. In this work, we apply a population decoding method to better estimate what information is available in neuronal ensembles and how this information is coded in dynamic patterns of neural activity in data recorded from inferior temporal cortex (ITC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) as macaque monkeys engaged in a delayed match-to-category task. Analyses of activity patterns in ITC and PFC revealed that both areas contain ``abstract'' category information (i.e., category information that is not directly correlated with properties of the stimuli); however, in general, PFC has more task-relevant information, and ITC has more detailed visual information. Analyses examining how information coded in these areas show that almost all category information is available in a small fraction of the neurons in the population. Most remarkably, our results also show that category information is coded by a nonstationary pattern of activity that changes over the course of a trial with individual neurons containing information on much shorter time scales than the population as a whole.},

We assume that neural recordings have been made from a number of trials in which different conditions were present, and our procedure produces an estimate of how accurately we can predict the labels of these conditions in a new set of data. We call this estimate of future prediction the ``decoding/readout accu- racy,'' and based on this measure we can make inferences about what information is present in the population of neurons and on how this information is coded. The steps we cover to obtain a measure of decoding accuracy include: (1) designing an experiment, (2) formatting the neural data, (3) selecting a classi er to use, (4) apply- ing cross-validation to random splits of the data, (5) evaluating decoding perfor- mance through different measures, and (6) testing the integrity of the decoding procedure and signi cance of the results. We also discuss additional topics, including how to examine questions about neural coding and how to evaluate whether the population is representing stimuli in an invariant/abstract way. Chapter 18 (Singer and Kreiman) discusses statistical classi ers in further detail. The ideas discussed here are applied in several chapters in this book including chapter 2 (Nirenberg), chapter 3 (Poort, Pooresmaeili, and Roelfsema), chapter 7 (Pasupathy and Brincat), chapter 10 (Hung and DiCarlo), chapter 21 (Panzeri and Ince), and chapter 22 (Berens, Logothetis, and Tolias).

The visual lexical decision results of the monolingual suggest morphological decomposition with low-frequency inflected nouns, while with medium- and high-frequency inflections, full-form processing was apparently employed. The bilinguals demonstrated a similar pattern. The results suggest that morpheme-based recognition is employed even in a morphologically limited language when the inflectional forms occur rarely. With more frequent inflectional forms, full-form representations have developed for both mono- and bilingual speakers. In a comparable study employing a morphologically rich language, Finnish, Lehtonen and Laine (2003, Bilingualism: Language and Cognition, 6, 213-225) observed full-form access only at the high-frequency range and only for monolinguals.

Relative to the other experimental conditions, the grammatical feature task activated areas of the left middle and inferior frontal gyrus and of the left middle and inferior temporal gyrus. These activations fit in well with neuropsychological studies that document the correlation between left frontal lesions and damage to morphological processes in agrammatism, and the correlation between left temporal lesions and failure to access lexical representations in anomia. Taken together, these data suggest that grammatical gender is processed in a left fronto-temporal network. In addition, the observation that the grammatical feature task and the phonology task activated neighboring but distinct regions of the left frontal lobe provides a plausible neuroanatomical basis for the systematic occurrence of phonological errors in aphasic subjects with morphological deficits.},

Each dialogue consisted of 4 speaking turns alternating between a male and a female speaker. Two different formulations of the ending remark were presented and Ss stated which one was more appropriate. Results show that when only 1 device was used for contrast, Ss preferred clefting for grammatical subjects and focal accent for complements. When both PRM and MPM were used, subjects were preferred over contrasted complements. Results demonstrate that Ss' judgments of the suitability of linguistic devices for expressing information contrasts in French were more affected by syntactic factors than conceptual ones.

Previous work demonstrated a direct correspondence between the hierarchy of the human visual areas and layers of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) trained on visual object recognition. We use DCNN to investigate which frequency bands correlate with feature transformations of increasing complexity along the ventral visual pathway. By capitalizing on intracranial depth recordings from 100 patients we assess the alignment between the DCNN and signals at different frequency bands. We find that gamma activity (30\textendash 70\,Hz) matches the increasing complexity of visual feature representations in DCNN. These findings show that the activity of the DCNN captures the essential characteristics of biological object recognition not only in space and time, but also in the frequency domain. These results demonstrate the potential that artificial intelligence algorithms have in advancing our understanding of the brain.},

Recently, an extreme form of multiple activation was observed: Bilingual listeners activated words from both languages that were consistent with the input. We explored the degree to which bilingual multiple activation may be constrained by fine-grained acoustic-phonetic information. In a head-mounted eyetracking experiment, we presented Spanish-English bilinguals with spoken Spanish words having word-initial stop consonants with either English- or Spanish-appropriate voice onset times. Participants fixated interlingual distractors (nontarget pictures whose English names shared a phonological similarity with the Spanish targets) more frequently than control distractors when the target words contained English-appropriate voice onset times. These results demonstrate that fine-grained acoustic-phonetic information and a precise match between input and representation are critical for parallel activation of two languages.},

A stark dissociation was found: while AW responded accurately with regular forms of verbs (walked) and nouns (gloves), performance was significantly less accurate with irregular forms (found; children). The appearance of a selective deficit for irregular forms in conditions of impaired lexical access is in line with dual-mechanism accounts, which proposes that irregular forms are specified in the lexicon whereas regular forms are computed via rule-based mechanisms. In contrast, AW's data are problematic for connectionist accounts that do not posit separate mechanisms for processing regular and irregular forms, including the connectionist model proposed by M. F.

Targets that were immediate or delayed repetitions of masked primes resulted in attenuation of the N400, with little or no enhancement of a late positive component (LPC). Delayed, in-the-clear repetitions of unmasked targets led to attenuation of the N400 and enhancement of the LPC. Experiment 2 (n=16; mean age 18.94 yrs) used similar stimulus timing parameters, but primes were unmasked. More typical unmasked repetition effects were observed for immediate repetitions including a larger attenuation of the N400 and enhancement of the LPC.

Studies of different languages have produced mixed results suggesting that semantic properties of compounding do not have a universal effect. This paper uses masked priming at three different SOAs to study the possible effects of semantic transparency and grammatical class on processing of Persian and Cantonese compounds. We found priming effects in all types of compounds across both languages regardless of semantic transparency and grammatical class. Our findings revealed processing patterns which were unique to each language. We contend that compounding is a complex process influenced by the interactions among the unique properties of each language such as productivity, headedness, and the writing system.}

  abstract = {The expressive power of language lies in its ability to construct an infinite array of ideas out of a finite set of pieces. Surprisingly, few neurolinguistic investigations probe the basic processes that constitute the foundation of this ability, choosing instead to focus on relatively complex combinatorial operations. Contrastingly, in the present work, we investigate the neural circuits underlying simple linguistic composition, such as required by the minimal phrase ``red boat.'' Using magnetoencephalography, we examined activity in humans generated at the visual presentation of target nouns, such as ``boat,'' and varied the combinatorial operations induced by its surrounding context. Nouns in minimal compositional contexts (``red boat'') were compared with those appearing in matched non-compositional contexts, such as after an unpronounceable consonant string (``xkq boat'') or within a list (``cup, boat''). Source analysis did not implicate traditional language areas (inferior frontal gyrus, posterior temporal regions) in such basic composition. Instead, we found increased combinatorial-related activity in the left anterior temporal lobe (LATL) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). These regions have been linked previously to syntactic (LATL) and semantic (vmPFC) combinatorial processing in more complex linguistic contexts. Thus, we suggest that these regions play a role in basic syntactic and semantic composition, respectively. Importantly, the temporal ordering of the effects, in which LATL activity ({$\sim$}225 ms) precedes vmPFC activity ({$\sim$}400 ms), is consistent with many processing models that posit syntactic composition before semantic composition during the construction of linguistic representations.},

One characterization (the ostension paradigm) is commonly held in theory-of-mind research but is, the author contends, misguided. A second conception of meaning, which the author has termed the contextual view, is offered as a corrective to the ostension paradigm. Like a fork in the road, the conclusion one draws about the nature of linguistic meaning subsequently influences how one studies and understands the developmental relations between language and theory of mind. This influence is highlighted throughout the chapter as meta-linguistic concerns are interwoven with data and theory from the theory-of-mind literature.

  abstract = {Is morphology a discrete and independent element of lexical structure or does it simply reflect a fine tuning of the system to the statistical correlation that exists among the orthographic and semantic properties of words? Imaging studies in English failed to show unequivocal morphological activation that is distinct from semantic or orthographic activation. Cognitive research in Hebrew has revealed that morphological decomposition is an important component of print processing. In Hebrew, morphological relatedness does not necessarily induce a clear semantic relatedness, thus, Hebrew provides a unique opportunity to investigate the neural substrates of morphological processing. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study, participants were required to perform judgment tasks of morphological relatedness, semantic relatedness, rhyming, and orthographic similarity. Half of the morphologically related words were semantically related and half were semantically unrelated. This design was chosen to induce explicit morphological processing. We identified two locations involved in morphological processing: the left middle frontal gyrus and the left inferior parietal sulcus. Comparing locations of morphological related activation to the locations of semantic and orthographic related activation, we found that the areas neighbored but only partially overlapped. The similarity in activation between the two morphological conditions eliminates the possibility that morphological activation simply results from the semantic properties of the words. These results demonstrate the important role of morphological processing in reading and suggest that morphological analysis is a distinct process of visual word recognition.

Results of a picture judgment task show that although L2 learners have largely acquired the correct lexico-syntactic classification of verbs in Turkish, they were constrained by the morphological patterns of their first language (L1) when learning derivational morphology, especially with causative/inchoative verbs. Results also show failure to reject transitivity errors and inappropriate derivational morphology with unaccusative, unergative, and noncausative/inchoative transitive verbs. The transitivity errors documented are analogous to the overgeneralization errors reported in the L1 and L2 acquisition literature of English and other languages. It is suggested that L2 learners incorrectly adopt the lexico-syntactic representation of change-of-state verbs (the semantic template of an accomplishment) when they are not clear about the event-type classification of a particular verb. The author also suggest that L2 learners are atuned to the rich morphology of Turkish and that the acquisition of serivational morphology and lexical semantics are not dissociated in these interlanguage grammars.

Results show that frontal lobe injury selectively impaired the natural tendency to seek stimulation from novel and unusual stimuli.

Tang, R. Tuma, S. Kahn, \& I. Rock, 1992). In the present study, participants reported which of 2 horizontal lines was longer. Dots in the background, if grouped, formed displays similar to the Ponzo illusion (Experiments 1 and 2) or the M\"uller-Lyer illusion (Experiment 3). Despite inaccurate reports of what the patterns were, participants' responses on the line-length discrimination task were clearly affected by the 2 illusions. These results suggest that Gestalt grouping does occur without attention but that the patterns thus formed may not be encoded in memory without attention.},

Since human operators are good controllers it follows that they must use mental models and hence the remaining problem is to elucidate their nature, but the literature on mental models is confused because mental models are used in situations other than manual control. A taxonomy is developed to describe the relation between different types of mental models, from those proposed by Johnson-Laird (1983) for logical problems to those proposed by Bainbridge (1991) and others for complex industrial processes. Such a taxonomy provides a coherent description of mental models which can clear up the conceptual difficulties noted by Wilson and Rutherford (1989). A brief outline is given of the application of Mapping Theory and Lattice Theory as formalisms for mental models, especially in relation to the use of Conant's Method to identify systems and models (Conant, 1976).},

Experiment 1 tested adult readers, showing that priming from both pseudo- and truly suffixed primes could be obtained using our own set of high-frequency word materials. Experiment 2 assessed a group of Year 3 and Year 5 children, but priming only occurred when prime and target shared a true morphological relationship, and not when the relationship was pseudomorphological. This pattern of results indicates that morpho-orthographic decomposition mechanisms do not become automatized until a relatively late stage in reading development.

In this study, the authors used event-related potentials to compare switches between two languages with within-language lexical switches as bilinguals read for comprehension. Stimuli included English sentences and idioms ending either with the expected English words, their Spanish translations (code switches), or English synonyms (lexical switches). As expected, lexical switches specifically enhanced the N400 response in both context types. Code switches, by contrast, elicited an increased negativity over left fronto-central sites in the regular nonidiomatic sentences (250\textendash 450 ms) and a large posterior positivity (450\textendash 850 ms) in both context types. In addition, both lexical and code switches elicited a late frontal positivity (650\textendash 850 ms) relative to expected completions, especially in idioms. Analysis of the individual response patterns showed correlations with vocabulary skills in English and in Spanish. Overall, the electrophysiological data suggest that for some speakers in some contexts, the processing of a code switch may actually be less costly than the processing of an unexpected within-language item.},

Thus, the insula may be a critical relay from action representation to emotion. We used functional MRI while subjects were either imitating or simply observing emotional facial expressions. Imitation and observation of emotions activated a largely similar network of brain areas. Within this network, there was greater activity during imitation, compared with observation of emotions, in premotor areas including the inferior frontal cortex, as well as in the superior temporal cortex, insula, and amygdala. We understand what others feel by a mechanism of action representation that allows empathy and modulates our emotional content. The insula plays a fundamental role in this mechanism.},

For students in the phonographic language background group, phonologically accessible characters (characters whose inner radical was a pronounceable katakana character) were easier to remember than phonologically inaccessible characters (characters whose inner radical was not pronounceable). In contrast, the absence of the pronounceable elements in the stimuli did not hinder the memory performance of the morphographic language background group. This interaction between L1 background and the phonological inaccessibility of stimuli is interpreted as showing that, due to their L1 experience, L2 learners from a morphographic language background use more flexible strategies for phonological decoding for new characters than learners from a phonographic language background.

In this study we extend this research by examining both lexical decision and word naming times taken from the English Lexicon Project . There was a syllable number effect for both tasks in the expected direction, and this effect was independent of the presence of a bigram trough. The research also examined the role of other bigram related variables and the number of morphemes on lexical decision and word naming times. The number of morphemes had a significant effect on both word processing tasks, with words with more morphemes producing faster reaction times and also fewer errors. This pattern was reversed for nonword lexical decision times. The results are discussed in the light of recent developments in models of reading.},

Subjects performed a lexical decision task. Behavioural results showed that all prime types significantly facilitated target recognition. Priming effects were reflected in the electrophysiological data by reduced N250 and N400 amplitudes, and these priming effects were statistically equivalent for the three types of prime. The strong priming effects found with simplex primes in the present study, compared with prior research, are thought to be due to the combination of targets always being completely embedded in prime stimuli plus the reduced lexical inhibition that arises with nonword primes. In line with prior behavioural research, however, there was evidence for differential priming effects as a function of prime type in the N400 ERP component in Experiment 2, with greater priming effects for derived and pseudocomplex primes relative to simplex primes at lateral posterior electrode sites.

In order to provide information about possible early effects of morphology we focused our analysis on the N250 ERP component. Priming effects for transparent and opaque items patterned together in the early phase of the N250 (200-250 ms), whereas the transparent and orthographic items patterned together in the latter phase of this component (250-300 ms). These results provide further evidence in support of the rapid extraction of morphemes from morphologically complex stimuli independently of the semantic relatedness of the whole and its parts.},

  abstract = {Two experiments are described on the visual processing of interlexical homographs in bilinguals using a priming paradigm. Interlexical homographs are words that have two distinct meanings for one graphemic form common to two languages (e.g., COIN means ``corner'' in French). English-French bilinguals were biased to read such interlexical homographs in one specific language mode reading. The results of the first experiment suggest that language mode context does not initially block access to the alternative reading of these homographs. The second experiment confirms that the meaning accessed is not affected by language mode context but depends more on the frequency of occurrence of the reading in each language. The results indicate that it is frequency rather than language that determines the order in which lexical entries are accessed. These results suggest that lexical access in bilinguals is not initially language-selective.}

Using a single-word paradigm, we did not find a LAN for any of the incorrect verb forms but found an N400-like effect for all irregular verbs. In the sentence context, only the incorrect irregulars elicited a long-lasting, broadly distributed late positivity, reminiscent of the P600. For regular verbs, responses to incorrect forms produced smaller, more time restricted effects. These data show that morphological and syntactic violations produce similar patterns of brain activity, suggesting that these two systems engage cognitive processes with similar underlying neural substrates.

In linguistics and psycholinguistics, morphology is the study of the internal structure of words which are the linguistic units that provide the main mapping between form and meaning. Word recognition has had a long and distinguished history in psycholinguistics, yet few models of lexical processing have included morphology as a level of linguistic representation. This may be because despite the ubiquity of multi-morphemic words, many current models of visual word recognition have been developed to model the mapping of orthography and phonology onto semantics\textemdash and thus have focused on morphologically simple words. Expanding the focus of research to include multi-morphemic words will significantly advance our understanding of reading by allowing us to evaluate the contribution of morphological analysis to the process of word recognition.},

The authors also explored whether infants find speech cues produced by coarticulation useful in word segmentation. Using natural speech syllables, the authors replicated J. R. Saffrin and R. N. Aslin, et al.'s (1996) study demonstrating that 8-mo-olds can segment a continuous stream of speech based on statistical cues alone. Next the authors added conflicting segmentation cues. Exp 2 pitted stress against statistics, whereas Exp 3 pitted coarticulation against statistics. In both cases, 8-mo-olds weighed speech cues more heavily than statistical cues. This observation was verified in Exp 4, which indicated that greater complexity of the familiarization sequence does not necessarily lead to familiarity effects.

We model the phenomenon that children acquire the morphological inflections of a language monotonically by introducing an algorithm that uses a bootstrapped, frequency-driven learning procedure to acquire rules monotonically. The algorithm learns a morphological grammar in terms of a Base and Transforms representation, a simple rule-based model of morphology. When tested on corpora of child-directed speech in English from CHILDES (MacWhinney in The CHILDES-Project: Tools for analyzing talk. Erlbaum, Hillsdale, 2000), the algorithm learns the most salient rules of English morphology and the order of acquisition is similar to that of children as observed by Brown (A first language: the early stages. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 1973). Investigations of statistical distributions in corpora reveal that the algorithm is able to acquire morphological grammars due to its exploitation of Zipfian distributions in morphology through type-frequency statistics. These investigations suggest that the computation and frequency-driven selection of discrete morphological rules may be important factors in children's acquisition of basic inflectional morphological systems.},

In both English and Russian, prepositions and nouns in prepositional phrases must be autonomous. Participants named high frequency words of 1 and 3 morphemes which were presented in a control condition and also presented in conditions which either preserved or disrupted the natural morpheme boundaries. Participants were also asked to read an expositional passage from a popular Israeli newspaper. Results showed that the Russians, although significantly more accurate than the English speakers at text reading, were significantly less accurate and slower than the English at the naming task, and less impaired by the experimental manipulations.

The theory is capable of accounting for results from a variety of models of reaction time distributions and it makes novel predictions. It provides a unified account of known changes in the shape of the distributions depending on properties of the task and of the participants, and it predicts additional changes that should be observed. We show that a number of known properties of \{RT\} distributions are homogeneously accounted for by variations in the value of two easily interpretable parameters, the coefficients of variation of the two normal variables. The predictions of the theory are compared with those of many families of distributions that have been proposed to account for \{RT\}s, indicating our theory provides a significantly better account of the data across tasks and modalities. In addition, a new methodology for analyzing \{RT\} data is derived from the theory, and we illustrate how it can be used to disentagle top-down and bottom-up effects in an experiment. Finally, we show how the theory links to neurobiological models of response latencies.},

Over 4 sessions, participants learned to use adjectives that had to agree in gender with nouns. Learners were then tested on various types of novel nouns.

We have empirically evaluated the technique in an experiment where the task requires detecting a target in the presence of distractors. We have also studied the signal-to-noise ratio and the resolving power of averages with and without binning. Results indicate that the method produces clearer representations of ERPs than either stimulus-locked and response-locked averaging, revealing finer details of ERPs and helping in the evaluation of the amplitude and latency of ERP waves.

  abstract = {Inflectional affixes are sensitive to morphological properties of the stems of the verbs they attach to. Therefore it is reasonable to assume that the inflectional material is combined with both the verbal stem of simplex verbs and the verbal stem of particle verbs. It has been argued that this leads to a bracketing paradox in the case of particle verbs since the semantic contribution of the inflectional information scopes over the complete particle verb. I will discuss nominalizations and adjective derivation, which are also problematic because of various bracketing paradoxes. I will suggest a solution to these paradoxes that assumes that inflectional and derivational prefixes and suffixes always attach to a form of a stem that contains the information about a possible particle already, but without containing a phonological realization of the particle. As is motivated by syntactic properties of particle verbs, the particle is treated as a dependent of the verb. The particle is combined with its head after inflection and derivation. With such an approach no special mechanisms for the analysis of particle verbs are necessary.}

In this work, we model this process using a recurrent neural network that is trained to map a set of plan vectors, representing meaning, to associated sequences of phonemes, representing the phonological structure of the surface forms. We evaluate the role of the similarity structure of the target forms (the adult vocabulary) and the similarity structure of the input forms (the semantic structure) on the evolution of the network's vocabulary. The model's performance offers a principled account of various phenomena associated with children's early vocabulary development including the difficulty of acquiring synonyms, the appearance of idiosyncratic forms and over-extension errors. The model makes several unexplored predictions for the developmental profiles of young children acquiring morphology.},

  abstract = {Background When a second target (T2) is presented in close succession of a first target (T1), people often fail to identify T2, a phenomenon known as the attentional blink (AB). However, the AB can be reduced substantially when participants are distracted during the task, for instance by a concurrent task, without a cost for T1 performance. The goal of the current study was to investigate the electrophysiological correlates of this paradoxical effect. Methodology/Principal Findings Participants successively performed three tasks, while EEG was recorded. The first task (standard AB) consisted of identifying two target letters in a sequential stream of distractor digits. The second task (grey dots task) was similar to the first task with the addition of an irrelevant grey dot moving in the periphery, concurrent with the central stimulus stream. The third task (red dot task) was similar to the second task, except that detection of an occasional brief color change in the moving grey dot was required. AB magnitude in the latter task was significantly smaller, whereas behavioral performance in the standard and grey dots tasks did not differ. Using mixed effects models, electrophysiological activity was compared during trials in the grey dots and red dot tasks that differed in task instruction but not in perceptual input. In the red dot task, both target-related parietal brain activity associated with working memory updating (P3) as well as distractor-related occipital activity was significantly reduced. Conclusions/Significance The results support the idea that the AB might (at least partly) arise from an overinvestment of attentional resources or an overexertion of attentional control, which is reduced when a distracting secondary task is carried out. The present findings bring us a step closer in understanding why and how an AB occurs, and how these temporal restrictions in selective attention can be overcome.},

The verb (pseudo-verb) of the sentences disagreed in number with the subject noun (pseudo-noun) in 50\% of the sentences. The Ss either read the sentences for an interspersed memory test or made a syntactic judgment after each real-word/pseudo-word sentence. While in the real-word condition a late and widespread positivity resembling a previously described syntactic positive shift was found for the disagreeing verbs, a negativity with an onset latency of about 300 msec was seen for the disagreeing pseudo-verbs. In the pseudo-word conditions no positivity followed the initial negativity. This dissociation of negative and positive waves occurring in response to morphosyntactic mismatches by the pseudo/real-word manipulation suggests that the positive shift is a concomitant of a recomputation routine initiated to account for the number incongruency. This routine is based upon the semantics of the sentence and therefore is not observed in the pseudo-word conditions. The earlier negativity appears to be a more direct index of morphosyntactic incongruency. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2002 APA, all rights reserved).},

It has been claimed that a late positivity (P600 or SPS [syntactic positive shift]) occurring to syntactic violations or ambiguities qualifies as such an effect. The present study compared ERPs elicited by morphosyntactic (case inflection errors), semantic, and orthographic (misspelled words) violations in a group of 20-27 yr old German Ss. All 3 types of violations gave rise to late positivities having the characteristics of the previously described P600/SPS. In an earlier time window, however, semantic violations were associated with a centroparietally distributed N400 component, whereas syntactic violations gave rise to a negativity of smaller amplitude that had a frontocentral distribution. In light of the present results, the view that the P600/SPS as a whole reflects specific syntactic processes appears to be untenable and an alternative interpretation is proposed.

  abstract = {It is not unusual for developmental psychologists to become frustrated with the theory of universal grammar (UG), whose proponents have tended to dismiss most research on children's language production and comprehension as irrelevant to explaining how human languages are acquired. This is because children's actual linguistic behaviour is presumed to reflect factors besides their grammatical competence, rendering most methods of sampling linguistic behaviour unsuitable for evaluating UG theory. This means, in practice, that UG proponents do not view performance errors as evidence against their hypothesis that grammatical knowledge is largely innate. When children perform at ceiling on a given task, this is usually taken as proof of their adultlike grammatical competence, while poor performance is dismissed as due to research design flaws or limitations in information processing capacities (e.g. working memory). Crain \& Thornton (1998) attempt to eliminate what they consider to be post hoc processing accounts of children's linguistic behaviour by arguing, counter to Chomsky (1965) and many others, that children and adults share identical language processing mechanisms, and that linguistic performance directly reflects grammatical competence. Therefore, if UG principles are available from an early age, child and adult performance should be the same when tasks are properly constructed to avoid extra-linguistic demand characteristics (excepting adult\textendash child differences predicted by parameter-setting or maturational models). It should not be surprising then that some psycholinguists, such as Drozd (target article), would find C\&T to be misguided with respect to these issues, because children's linguistic behaviour surely differs from adults' in seemingly unpredictable ways.},

The difference between the ERPs to the primed and unprimed stems was taken as a measure of morphological priming. The ERPs to regular verbs were clearly different from those to irregular verbs: the former were associated with an N400 reduction in the primed condition; primed irregular verb stems, however, showed no such effect. Control conditions demonstrated that the N400 modulation for regular verbs cannot be attributed to formal (i.e., phonological or orthographical) priming. These ERP effects indicate that regular verbs serve as more powerful primes for their corresponding stem forms than irregular past tense forms, suggesting that regular (but not irregular) past tense forms may be decomposed into stem plus affix.

When a test word was identical to 1 of the learned words, recognition was facilitated in the usual way.

However, learning a word with comparable visual-acoustic similarity but no morphemic relation to test word gave only slight, nonsignificant facilitation of recognition. It is concluded that the process of recognizing a word involves assigning it to a linguistic unit with specific semantic associations (i.e., a morpheme). Analysis of error responses suggests that, to some extent, root and suffix morphemes are recognized independently, and that suffixes themselves may be subject to frequency effects. The principles underlying the phenomena studied may be characterized as "the morpheme-frequency effect." (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Next we present an overview of the studies included in this issue, organized by current issues concerning the role of morphological knowledge in literacy. Collectively, the articles in this issue suggest that students with weaker literacy skills tend to lag behind their peers in morphological knowledge but that all students are likely to benefit from morphological instruction.

The process of morpho-orthographic decomposition was primed by the prior presentation of complex non-words (formed by the combination a legal stem and legal affix, e.g. huntity, cornity, scanity) as prime stimuli. Targets were semantically transparent complex words (e.g., hunter), semantically opaque pseudocomplex words (e.g., corner), and simplex words (e.g., scandal) that contained the same stem as primes or a different stem (e.g., huntity-hunter vs. farmity-hunter). We found a large early (150\textendash 200 ms) priming effect for transparent complex words only, followed by widely distributed priming effects between 200 and 300 ms and more spatially focused N400 priming effects for all types of target. Furthermore, in the 150\textendash 200 ms time-window, the ERP waveforms generated by pseudocomplex words patterned with those of complex words, both of which generated less negative-going waveforms compared with simplex words. In the N400 time-window, on the other hand, complex words differed from both pseudocomplex and simplex words. The results provide further support for early morpho-orthographic segmentation processes that operate independently of semantic transparency, and suggest that the output of these processes only affects the subsequent processing of truly complex words.},

However, reducing the proportion of related primes and targets reduced formal priming. It was thus suggested that the formal priming was only apparent and due to strategic inhibition of responses to unrelated prime-target pairs. The final experiment reduced the proportion of responses to related targets further and examined formal priming at lags of 0, 1, 3, and 10. No formal priming was found. Data indicate that the formal priming was due to changes in levels of inhibitory priming in comparison conditions. It is concluded that evidence for an orthographic or phonological organization of the lexicon is not obtainable using priming procedures.

  abstract = {We have used positron emission tomography (PET), which measures regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), to demonstrate directly the specialization of function in the normal human visual cortex. A novel technique, statistical parametric mapping, was used to detect foci of significant change in cerebral blood flow within the prestriate cortex, in order to localize those parts involved in the perception of color and visual motion. For color, we stimulated the subjects with a multicolored abstract display containing no recognizable objects (Land color Mondrian) and contrasted the resulting blood flow maps with those obtained when subjects viewed an identical display consisting of equiluminous shades of gray. The comparison identified a unique area (area V4) located in the lingual and fusiform gyri of the prestriate cortex. For motion, blood flow maps when subjects viewed moving or stationary black and white random-square patterns were contrasted. The comparison identified a unique area located in the region of the temporo-parieto-occipital junction (area V5). We thus provide direct evidence to show that, just as in the macaque monkey, different areas of the human prestriate visual cortex are specialized for different attributes of vision. The striate cortex (V1) and the contiguous visual area (V2), which in the monkey brain feed both the homologous areas, were active in all 4 conditions. This pattern of activity allowed us to use an extension of the approach to assess the functional relationship between the 3 areas during color and motion stimulation. This is based on an hypothesis-led analysis of the covariance structure of the blood flow maps and promises to be a powerful tool for inferring anatomical pathways in the normal human brain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

An attempt was made in all experiments to minimize nonlexical contributions to these lexical effects by placing related items in a context of unrelated items. Priming among regularly and irregularly suffixed morphemic relatives, associates, and synonyms was examined. Morphemic relatives and associates yielded significant priming, although priming was largest for regularly suffixed morphemic relatives. Priming was not obtained for synonyms. In previous research (Napps \& Fowler, 1987), priming was not found among orthographically and phonologically related words.

(1989) proposed that, due to the rapid drop-off of visual acuity, the amount of visual information available from a word is maximal when the eye fixates the middle of the word, and decreases on both sides of this optimal viewing position with each letter of deviation. However, data on perceptual span have demonstrated that during a fixation, more letters are utilized to the right than to the left of the fixation point, which would predict that the optimal viewing position should be left of center. In a letter discrimination task, the ratio of the left/right asymmetry was determined and the probability of correct word recognition as a function of fixation location in the word was estimated. The predictions were highly compatible with empirical results on word recognition.},

This study unconfounded these two probabilities in a lexical decision task with category names as primes and with high- and low-dominance exemplars as targets. Semantic priming for high-dominance exemplars was modulated by the relatedness proportion and, to a lesser degree, by the nonword ratio. However, the nonword ratio exerted a stronger influence than did the relatedness proportion on semantic priming for low-dominance exemplars and on the nonword facilitation effect (i.e., the superiority in performance for nonword targets that follow a category name rather than a neutral XXX prime). These results suggest that semantic priming for lexical decisions is affected by both a prospective prime-generated expectancy, modulated by the relatedness proportion, and a retrospective target/prime semantic matching process, modulated by the nonword ratio.},

  abstract = {(from the chapter) In this chapter the author argues that adherence to the formulation "theory of mind" has narrowed the scope of attention to developments that contribute to children's ability to understand social and psychological phenomena. Developments in infancy and early childhood, such as shared attention and imitation, that are generally seen as precursors or predispositions to later theory of mind are, in the present view, better conceived as general characteristics of early development that have wide-ranging influences on all areas of psychological growth. At the same time, areas of competence, such as general reasoning, that are considered outside the "domain" of theory of mind can be shown to be crucial to its achievement, as it is usually evaluated in terms of the understanding of false belief. The resulting focus, the author argues, has led theorists down a path that obscures the true importance of developments in early childhood, of which performance on theory-of-mind tasks is but one achievement. Further, and more germane to the questions raised in this volume, the author argues that language is the most important general function that leads to higher-order cognitive processes, including the processes involved in theory of mind, and that these developments begin to have their effects during the preschool years.

Although the L1 group's performance was influenced by the combinatorial structure of regular participle forms, this was not the case for the L2 group.

Amplitude asymmetries of ERP components recorded from occipital regions of the two hemispheres varied systematically with the position of the word in the visual field. On the other hand, ERPs from more anterior (temporal and frontal) regions displayed large asymmetries which were in the same direction regardless of the visual field of word presentation. The most prominent such asymmetry was in the negativity in the region 300\textendash 500 msec (N410) which was larger in the left than the right hemisphere in every subject.

From a diachronic perspective, the LS is a relic of a now obsolete spelling system. Synchronically, however, it is homographic and homophonic with the high-frequency inflectional affixes -e and -en. Are plural semantics (PSs) activated in the mental lexicon when the LS is written as the plural suffix -en? This question is addressed by means of 4 experiments in which 102 undergraduates participated. Exp 1 (progressive demasking) showed that perceptual identification is not affected by whether the LS is realised as -en or -e. Exp 2 (number decision) showed that changing the orthographic realisation of the LS from e- to en- induces the activation of PSs. Exp 3 focused on compounds for which the LS is realised as -en both in the old and new spelling system. Exp 4 (plurality rating) showed that the 1st constituents of Dutch nominal compounds can have PSs as part of their central semantic representations. It is revealed that writing the LS in the orthographic form of the plural suffix does lead to the activation of the PSs, even when PSs are not intended.

  abstract = {A spoken language eye-tracking methodology was used to evaluate the effects of sentence context and proficiency on parallel language activation during spoken language comprehension. Nonnative speakers with varying proficiency levels viewed visual displays while listening to French sentences (e.g., Marie va d\'ecrire la poule [Marie will describe the chicken]). Displays depicted several objects including the final noun target (chicken) and an interlingual near-homophone (e.g., pool) whose name in English is phonologically similar to the French target (poule). Listeners' eye movements reflected temporary consideration of the interlingual competitor when hearing the target noun, demonstrating cross-language lexical competition. However, competitor fixations were dramatically reduced when prior sentence information was incompatible with the competitor (e.g., Marie va nourrir\ldots{} [Marie will feed\ldots ]). In contrast, interlingual competition from English did not vary according to participants' rated proficiency in French, even though proficiency reliably predicted other aspects of processing behavior, suggesting higher proficiency in the active language does not provide a significant independent source of control over interlingual competition. The results provide new insights into the nature of parallel language activation in naturalistic sentential contexts. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

  abstract = {We investigated the influence of English proficiency on ERPs elicited by lexical semantic violations in English sentences, in both native English speakers and native Spanish speakers who learned English in adulthood. All participants were administered a standardized test of English proficiency, and data were analyzed using linear mixed effects (LME) modeling. Relative to native learners, late learners showed reduced amplitude and delayed onset of the N400 component associated with reading semantic violations. As well, after the N400 late learners showed reduced anterior negative scalp potentials and increased posterior potentials. In both native and late learners, N400 amplitudes to semantically appropriate words were larger for people with lower English proficiency. N400 amplitudes to semantic violations, however, were not influenced by proficiency. Although both N400 onset latency and the late ERP effects differed between L1 and L2 learners, neither correlated with proficiency. Different approaches to dealing with the high degree of correlation between proficiency and native/late learner group status are discussed in the context of LME modeling. The results thus indicate that proficiency can modulate ERP effects in both L1 and L2 learners, and for some measures (in this case, N400 amplitude), L1-L2 differences may be entirely accounted for by proficiency. On the other hand, not all effects of L2 learning can be attributed to proficiency. Rather, the differences in N400 onset and the post-N400 violation effects appear to reflect fundamental differences in L1-L2 processing.},

Subjects performed a visual target detection task in which they mentally counted the number of occurrences of pictorial stimuli from a designated category such as butterflies. In separate experiments, target stimuli were embedded within a series of other stimuli including unfamiliar human faces and isolated face components, inverted faces, distorted faces, animal faces, and other nonface stimuli. Human faces evoked a negative potential at 172 msec (N170), which was absent from the ERPs elicited by other animate and inanimate nonface stimuli. N170 was largest over the posterior temporal scalp and was larger over the right than the left hemisphere. N170 was delayed when faces were presented upside-down, but its amplitude did not change. When presented in isolation, eyes elicited an N170 that was significantly larger than that elicited by whole faces, while noses and lips elicited small negative ERPs about 50 msec later than N170. Distorted human faces, in which the locations of inner face components were altered, elicited an N170 similar in amplitude to that elicited by normal faces. However, faces of animals, human hands, cars, and items of furniture did not evoke N170. N170 may reflect the operation of a neural mechanism tuned to detect (as opposed to identify) human faces, similar to the ``structural encoder'' suggested by Bruce and Young (1986). A similar function has been proposed for the face-selective N200 ERP recorded from the middle fusiform and posterior inferior temporal gyri using subdural electrodes in humans (Allison, McCarthy, Nobre, Puce, \& Belger, 1994c). However, the differential sensitivity of N170 to eyes in isolation suggests that N170 may reflect the activation of an eye-sensitive region of cortex. The voltage distribution of N170 over the scalp is consistent with a neural generator located in the occipitotemporal sulcus lateral to the fusiform/inferior temporal region that generates N200.},

Nevertheless, an ongoing debate concerns the brain structures that subserve this process. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, the present study varied the internal complexity of derived words while keeping the external surface structure constant as well as controlling relevant parameters that could affect word recognition. This allowed us to tease apart brain activations specifically related to morphological processing from those related to possible confounds of perceptual cues like word length or affix type. Increased task-related activity in left inferior frontal, bilateral temporo-occipital and right parietal areas was specifically related to the processing of derivations with high complex internal structure relative to those with low complex internal structure. Our results show, that morphologically complex words are decomposed and that the brain processes the degree of internal complexity of word derivations.

For the output lexicon, the model predicts that both inflected and productive derived forms have decomposed representations. In the case of marked stem variation, the model assumes that the stems are represented by their allomorphs, and not by a single morph. This model postulates more suppletion in the input/output lexicons than would be predicted on the basis of formal morphological analyses.

But a pronoun is only really ambiguous if a reader or listener indeed perceives it to be ambiguous. Whether this is the case may depend on at least two factors: the language processing skills of an individual reader, and the contextual bias towards one particular referential interpretation. In the current study, we used event related brain potentials (ERPs) to explore how both these factors affect the resolution of referentially ambiguous pronouns. We compared ERPs elicited by formally ambiguous and non-ambiguous pronouns that were embedded in simple sentences (e.g., "Jennifer Lopez told Madonna that she had too much money."). Individual differences in language processing skills were assessed with the Reading Span task, while the contextual bias of each sentence (up to the critical pronoun) had been assessed in a referential cloze pretest. In line with earlier research, ambiguous pronouns elicited a sustained, frontal negative shift relative to non-ambiguous pronouns at the group-level. The size of this effect was correlated with Reading Span score, as well as with contextual bias. These results suggest that whether a reader perceives a formally ambiguous pronoun to be ambiguous is subtly co-determined by both individual language processing skills and contextual bias.},

In the current study, we examined whether this ERP effect reflects ``deep'' situation model ambiguity or ``superficial'' textbase ambiguity. We contrasted these different interpretations by investigating whether a discourse-level semantic manipulation that prevents referential ambiguity also averts the elicitation of a referentially induced ERP effect. We compared ERPs elicited by nouns that were referentially nonambiguous but were associated with two discourse entities (e.g., ``the girl'' with two girls introduced in the context, but one of which has died or left the scene), with referentially ambiguous and nonambiguous control words. Although temporally referentially ambiguous nouns elicited a frontal negative shift compared to control words, the ``double bound'' but referentially nonambiguous nouns did not. These results suggest that it is possible to selectively track referential ambiguity with ERPs at the level that is most relevant to discourse comprehension, the situation model.},

In each experiment, mismatching pronouns elicited a sustained, frontal negative shift (Nref) compared to matching pronouns: when participants were instructed to posit a new referent for mismatching pronouns (Experiment 1), and without this instruction (Experiments 2 and 3). In Experiments 1 and 2, the observed Nref was robust only in individuals with higher reading span scores. In Experiment 1, participants with lower reading span showed P600 effects instead, consistent with an attempt at coreferential interpretation despite gender mismatch.

In each experiment, whole-word frequency and root frequency were independently manipulated, where pairs of words differing on one variable and matched on the other were inserted into the same sentence frame. For derived words, root morpheme frequency affected processing earlier than did whole-word frequency: it affected the duration of the first fixation, whereas whole-word frequency affected processing only beginning on the second fixation. In contrast, for (the regular) inflected words, word frequency had significant effects beginning on the first fixation, whereas root frequency had significant effects beginning with the first fixation duration only for plural nouns and not for inflected verbs. Subsequent regression analyses on the inflected words suggested that the usual part of speech for the stem may play a significant role in processing. The data thus indicate that in normal reading, both the whole word as a unit and the root morpheme play a significant role in processing.},

Vocabulary knowledge was also assessed because it served as the link between derivational morphological awareness and second language reading comprehension. In the German group, none of the predictors were significantly correlated with reading comprehension, whereas there was evidence of crosslinguistic derivational morphological awareness transfer. However, Germans' reading comprehension score was not significantly different from the reading score in the Russian group where there was no evidence of the crosslinguistic derivational morphological awareness transfer. Russian derivational morphological awareness was not significantly correlated with reading comprehension, although the other independent variables (English derivational morphological awareness and vocabulary knowledge) were found to predict reading comprehension.},

  doi = {10.1126/science.aac4716},
  abstract = {One of the central goals in any scientific endeavor is to understand causality. Experiments that seek to demonstrate a cause/effect relation most often manipulate the postulated causal factor. Aarts et al. describe the replication of 100 experiments reported in papers published in 2008 in three high-ranking psychology journals. Assessing whether the replication and the original experiment yielded the same result according to several criteria, they find that about one-third to one-half of the original findings were also observed in the replication study.Science, this issue 10.1126/science.aac4716INTRODUCTIONReproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. Scientific claims should not gain credence because of the status or authority of their originator but by the replicability of their supporting evidence. Even research of exemplary quality may have irreproducible empirical findings because of random or systematic error.RATIONALEThere is concern about the rate and predictors of reproducibility, but limited evidence. Potentially problematic practices include selective reporting, selective analysis, and insufficient specification of the conditions necessary or sufficient to obtain the results. Direct replication is the attempt to recreate the conditions believed sufficient for obtaining a previously observed finding and is the means of establishing reproducibility of a finding with new data. We conducted a large-scale, collaborative effort to obtain an initial estimate of the reproducibility of psychological science.RESULTSWe conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. There is no single standard for evaluating replication success. Here, we evaluated reproducibility using significance and P values, effect sizes, subjective assessments of replication teams, and meta-analysis of effect sizes. The mean effect size (r) of the replication effects (Mr = 0.197, SD = 0.257) was half the magnitude of the mean effect size of the original effects (Mr = 0.403, SD = 0.188), representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had significant results (P \&lt; .05). Thirty-six percent of replications had significant results; 47\% of original effect sizes were in the 95\% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39\% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68\% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.CONCLUSIONNo single indicator sufficiently describes replication success, and the five indicators examined here are not the only ways to evaluate reproducibility. Nonetheless, collectively these results offer a clear conclusion: A large portion of replications produced weaker evidence for the original findings despite using materials provided by the original authors, review in advance for methodological fidelity, and high statistical power to detect the original effect sizes. Moreover, correlational evidence is consistent with the conclusion that variation in the strength of initial evidence (such as original P value) was more predictive of replication success than variation in the characteristics of the teams conducting the research (such as experience and expertise). The latter factors certainly can influence replication success, but they did not appear to do so here.Reproducibility is not well understood because the incentives for individual scientists prioritize novelty over replication. Innovation is the engine of discovery and is vital for a productive, effective scientific enterprise. However, innovative ideas become old news fast. Journal reviewers and editors may dismiss a new test of a published idea as unoriginal. The claim that ``we already know this'' belies the uncertainty of scientific evidence. Innovation points out paths that are possible; replication points out paths that are likely; progress relies on both. Replication can increase certainty when findings are reproduced and promote innovation when they are not. This project provides accumulating evidence for many findings in psychological research and suggests that there is still more work to do to verify whether we know what we think we know.Original study effect size versus replication effect size (correlation coefficients).Diagonal line represents replication effect size equal to original effect size. Dotted line represents replication effect size of 0. Points below the dotted line were effects in the opposite direction of the original. Density plots are separated by significant (blue) and nonsignificant (red) effects.Reproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown.

The relevant set of words (the word's neighbors) was previously defined to be those lexical units differing from the target stimulus by a single letter in a given position. Recent evidence has revealed that a better definition of a word's neighborhood includes lexical units of different length and lexical units created by transpositions. The study of a word's neighborhood has revealed that that the activation of neighbors may interfere with the processing of the target words in word-identification tasks and during sentence reading, supporting the basic claims of interactive activation models. Some challenges to the current definitions of the sets of word neighborhoods are also examined, in particular the need to include differences between how consonants and vowels are encoded during word processing.

Feedback is accordingly unnecessary and spoken word recognition is modular. To defend this thesis, we analyse lexical involvement in phonemic decision making. TRACE (McClelland \& Elman 1986), a model with feedback from the lexicon to prelexical processes, is unable to account for all the available data on phonemic decision making. The modular Race model (Cutler \& Norris 1979) is likewise challenged by some recent results, however. We therefore present a new modular model of phonemic decision making, the Merge model. In Merge, information flows from prelexical processes to the lexicon without feedback. Because phonemic decisions are based on the merging of prelexical and lexical information, Merge correctly predicts lexical involvement in phonemic decisions in both words and nonwords. Computer simulations show how Merge is able to account for the data through a process of competition between lexical hypotheses. We discuss the issue of feedback in other areas of language processing and conclude that modular models are particularly well suited to the problems and constraints of speech recognition.},

  abstract = {Reading is a complex process that draws on a remarkable number of diverse perceptual and cognitive processes. In this review, I provide an overview of computational models of reading, focussing on models of visual word recognition\textendash how we recognise individual words. Early computational models had `toy' lexicons, could simulate only a narrow range of phenomena, and frequently had fundamental limitations, such as being able to handle only four-letter words. The most recent models can use realistic lexicons, can simulate data from a range of tasks, and can process words of different lengths. These models are the driving force behind much of the empirical work on reading. I discuss how the data have guided model development and, importantly, I also provide guidelines to help interpret and evaluate the contribution the models make to our understanding of how we read.},

Of the 2 algorithms considered for formalizing how the evidence sampled from a prime and target is combined, only 1 was shown to be consistent with the existing data from the visual word recognition literature. This algorithm was incorporated into the Bayesian Reader model (D. Norris, 2006), and its predictions were confirmed in 3 experiments. The experiments showed that the pattern of masked priming is not a fixed function of the relations between the prime and the target but can be changed radically by changing the task from lexical decision to a same-different judgment. Implications of the Bayesian framework of masked priming for unconscious cognition and visual masking are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Here, we suggest that there is no orthographic code to crack: Words are perceived and represented as sequences of letters, just as in a dictionary. Indeed, words are perceived and represented in exactly the same way as other visual objects. The phenomena that have been taken as evidence for specialized orthographic representations can be explained by assuming that perception involves recovering information that has passed through a noisy channel: the early stages of visual perception. The noisy channel introduces uncertainty into letter identity, letter order, and even whether letters are present or absent. We develop a computational model based on this simple principle and show that it can accurately simulate lexical decision data from the lexicon projects in English, French, and Dutch, along with masked priming data that have been taken as evidence for specialized orthographic representations.

In each of the three versions the targeted verbs were rendered with both real and nonsense words. After reading one version, Ss completed a written recall task and also a sentence recognition task. Among their results, the authors find that neither lexical or morphosyntactic modifications significantly affect learners' comprehension of the passage. They discuss this finding within interactive models of reading, arguing that any one of a number of components can compensate for any other which might be weak or deficient. Their findings reveal that lexeme modifications and their interaction with morphosyntactic modifications significantly affect such recognition. Thus, learners are able to recognize structures in the input. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (book)},

In a lexical decision task it was found that SCF facilitates visual word recognition for low-frequency words, but not for high-frequency words. For nonwords, it was observed that those with high-SCF are harder to distinguish from words than nonwords with low-SCF. In contrast, a standard and purely orthographic measure of sublexical structure, Bigram Frequency, did not produce an effect in our study, when SCF was controlled. Thus, it is concluded that SCF is a promising first step towards indexing phonographic sublexical processing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2005 APA, all rights reserved).},

We used small-voxel functional magnetic resonance imaging to study information encoded in local brain activation patterns elicited by consonant-vowel syllables, and by a control set of noise bursts. First, activation of anterior\textendash lateral superior temporal cortex was seen when controlling for unspecific acoustic processing (syllables versus band-passed noises, in a ``classic'' subtraction-based design). Second, a classifier algorithm, which was trained and tested iteratively on data from all subjects to discriminate local brain activation patterns, yielded separations of cortical patches discriminative of vowel category versus patches discriminative of stop-consonant category across the entire superior temporal cortex, yet with regional differences in average classification accuracy. Overlap (voxels correctly classifying both speech sound categories) was surprisingly sparse. Third, lending further plausibility to the results, classification of speech\textendash noise differences was generally superior to speech\textendash speech classifications, with the no\textbackslash{} exception of a left anterior region, where speech\textendash speech classification accuracies were significantly better. These data demonstrate that acoustic\textendash phonetic features are encoded in complex yet sparsely overlapping local patterns of neural activity distributed hierarchically across different regions of the auditory cortex. The redundancy apparent in these multiple patterns may partly explain the robustness of phonemic representations.},

Although the extraction of such regularities, or statistical learning (SL), is typically viewed as a cortical process, recent studies have implicated the medial temporal lobe (MTL), including the hippocampus. These studies have employed fMRI, leaving open the possibility that the MTL is involved but not necessary for SL. Here, we examined this issue in a case study of LSJ, a patient with complete bilateral hippocampal loss and broader MTL damage. In Experiments 1 and 2, LSJ and matched control participants were passively exposed to a continuous sequence of shapes, syllables, scenes, or tones containing temporal regularities in the co-occurrence of items. In a subsequent test phase, the control groups exhibited reliable SL in all conditions, successfully discriminating regularities from recombinations of the same items into novel foil sequences. LSJ, however, exhibited no SL, failing to discriminate regularities from foils. Experiment 3 ruled out more general explanations for this failure, such as inattention during exposure or difficulty following test instructions, by showing that LSJ could discriminate which individual items had been exposed. These findings provide converging support for the importance of the MTL in extracting temporal regularities.},

Of the multiple sources of NE in the brain, the locus coeruleus (LC) plays a major role in noradrenergic signaling. Processes from the LC primarily release NE over widespread brain regions via non-junctional varicosities. We here review the actions of NE in astrocytes, microglial cells, and neurons based on the idea that the overarching effect of signaling from the LC is to maximize brain power, which is accomplished via an orchestrated cellular response involving most, if not all cell types in CNS.},

There are at least three reasons for this: (a) some meaning distinctions appear to be more complex conceptually than others, and so take longer to learn; (b) some paradigms are less regular than others, and they too take longer to learn; and (c) language typology may affect the process of morphological acquisition: suffixes, for instance, are acquired more readily, and earlier, than prefixes.},

  abstract = {A striking property of speech perception is its resilience in the face of acoustic variability (among speech sounds produced by different speakers at different times, for example). The robustness of speech perception might, in part, result from multiple, complementary representations of the input, which operate in both acoustic\textendash phonetic feature-based and articulatory\textendash gestural domains. Recent studies of the anatomical and functional organization of the non-human primate auditory cortical system point to multiple, parallel, hierarchically organized processing pathways that involve the temporal, parietal and frontal cortices. Functional neuroimaging evidence indicates that a similar organization might underlie speech perception in humans. These parallel, hierarchical processing `streams', both within and across hemispheres, might operate on distinguishable, complementary types of representations and subserve complementary types of processing. Two long-opposing views of speech perception have posited a basis either in acoustic feature processing or in gestural motor processing; the view put forward here might help reconcile these positions.},

  abstract = {(from the chapter) The focus of this chapter is the pragmatic ability to provide a listener with information that is new rather than information that is already known by the listener and that would be old (or, as it is usually referred to by linguists, given) and presumably of little interest. The distinction between new and given information has been a recurring theme the author's work over the past ten years, during which time it has become apparent to her that the notion of new information can be very slippery. That is, in different contexts it appears to mean very different things. In this chapter, the author does not attempt to provide a complete description of what it means to communicate new information. Instead, a description is given of a diverse set of studies--involving children making requests, commenting on events, and learning new words--that, taken together, emphasize different ways of conceptualizing new information and that pose an interesting challenge with respect to describing what kind of an understanding of mind might underlie a child's ability to assess new and given information in these different situations. Toward the end of the chapter, the author also provides an overview of how new/given information is defined within the context of adult communication, in order to appraise the young child's competence. This chapter is ended by situating this discussion of what is "new" within the larger domain of pragmatics and theory of mind, with particular reference to a few of the other chapters in this volume.

  abstract = {In human electrophysiology, a considerable corpus of studies using event-related potentials have investigated inhibitory processes by employing the 'go-nogo' paradigm, which requires responding to one type of event while withholding the response to another type of event. Two event-related potential waveform features (N2 and P3) have been associated with larger amplitude in nogo trials than in go trials. Traditionally, these differences were thought to reflect response inhibition. Recently, the source localization of N2 to the anterior cingulate cortex, as well as the colocalization of N2 with error-related negativity, has been interpreted in terms of conflict monitoring. In order to isolate the contribution of inhibitory processes, we matched the frequency of the go and nogo events, thus minimizing differences in response conflict between event types. A data-driven analytical procedure contrasted go with nogo events across the entire event-related potential segment and found that N2 reliably differentiated between the two conditions while P3 did not. Tomographical analyses of the N2 difference observed in conditions of equal go and nogo trial frequency localized N2 to the right ventral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Because a growing body of evidence implicates these brain regions in inhibitory processes, we conclude that N2 does, at least in part, reflect inhibition.

Within Ss, larger N2-P3 amplitudes in response to novel stimuli were associated with longer viewing durations on those stimuli.

The current study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (N~=~25) in conjunction with an artificial language learning paradigm to provide new insight into the neural mechanisms of statistical learning, considering both the online process of extracting statistical regularities and the subsequent offline recognition of learned patterns. Notably, prior fMRI studies on statistical learning have not contrasted neural activation during the learning and recognition experimental phases. Here, we found that learning is supported by the superior temporal gyrus and the anterior cingulate gyrus, while subsequent recognition relied on the left inferior frontal gyrus. Besides, prior studies only assessed the brain response during the recognition of trained words relative to novel nonwords. Hence, a further key goal of this study was to understand how the brain supports recognition of discrete constituents from the continuous input versus recognition of mere statistical structure that is used to build new constituents that are statistically congruent with the ones from the input. Behaviorally, recognition performance indicated that statistically congruent novel tokens were less likely to be endorsed as parts of the familiar environment than discrete constituents. fMRI data showed that the left intraparietal sulcus and angular gyrus support the recognition of old discrete constituents relative to novel statistically congruent items, likely reflecting an additional contribution from memory representations for trained items.},

There is an optimal viewing position near the middle or slightly left of the middle where the time taken is shortest. For each letter of deviation from this optimal position, about 20 msec is added to lexical decision time or naming latency. The effect is present even in short 4- and 5-letter words.

In experiment 2, 30 participants (13 females and 17 males, aged 18-22 yrs) passively listened without making overt responses. In both experiments the recognition points for words (the point past which no other lexical item was consistent with the acoustic signal) and deviation points for pseudowords (the point past which no real word is compatible with the acoustic signal) were manipulated. An event-related potentials negativity in the region of the N400 component and reaction time (RT) occurred sooner for items with early than late recognition/deviation points. In experiment 1, early and late words produced N400s and RTs with indistinguishable latencies, while late pseudowords produced faster RTs and earlier N400s than early pseudowords.

In a review of findings from language development, language breakdown and real-time processing, we conclude that the case for a modular distinction between grammar and the lexicon has been overstated, and that the evidence to date is compatible with a unified lexicalist account. Studies of normal children show that the emergence of grammar is highly dependent upon vocabulary size, a finding confirmed and extended in atypical populations. Studies of language breakdown in older children and adults provide no evidence for a modular dissociation between grammar and the lexicon; some structures are especially vulnerable to brain damage (e.g. function words, non-canonical word orders), but this vulnerability is also observed in neurologically intact individuals under perceptual degradation or cognitive overload. Finally, on-line studies provide evidence for early and intricate interactions between lexical and grammatical information in normal adults. A possible characterization of this unified lexical processor is offered, based on distributed representations in recurrent neural networks.},

The claim that metaphoricity can be represented in terms of the relative degrees of salience of matching (or matchable) attributes of the 2 terms in a comparison is advanced. A modification of A. Tversky's (1977) account of similarity is proposed, and its implications for similarity statements and for the psychological processes involved in their comprehension are discussed. It is argued that the general account of similarity proposed, including as it does nonliteral similarity, can form not only the basis of a theory of metaphor but can also give a credible account of the relationship between metaphor, analogy, and similarity.

The study first presents 2 experiments in Serbian, which reveal for sentential reading the inflectional paradigmatic effects previously observed by Milin, Filipovi\'c \DJ ur\dj evi\'c, and Moscoso del Prado Mart\'in (2009) for unprimed lexical decision. The empirical results are successfully modeled without having to assume separate representations for inflections or data structures such as inflectional paradigms. In the next step, the same naive discriminative learning approach is pitted against a wide range of effects documented in the morphological processing literature. Frequency effects for complex words as well as for phrases (Arnon \& Snider, 2010) emerge in the model without the presence of whole-word or whole-phrase representations. Family size effects (Moscoso del Prado Mart\'in, Bertram, H\"aiki\"o, Schreuder, \& Baayen, 2004; Schreuder \& Baayen, 1997) emerge in the simulations across simple words, derived words, and compounds, without derived words or compounds being represented as such. It is shown that for pseudo-derived words no special morpho-orthographic segmentation mechanism, as posited by Rastle, Davis, and New (2004), is required. The model also replicates the finding of Plag and Baayen (2009) that, on average, words with more productive affixes elicit longer response latencies; at the same time, it predicts that productive affixes afford faster response latencies for new words. English phrasal paradigmatic effects modulating isolated word reading are reported and modeled, showing that the paradigmatic effects characterizing Serbian case inflection have crosslinguistic scope.

  abstract = {Sentences are represented as hierarchical syntactic structures, which have been successfully modeled in sentence processing. In contrast, despite the theoretical agreement on hierarchical syntactic structures within words, words have been argued to be computationally less complex than sentences and implemented by finite-state models as linear strings of morphemes, and even the psychological reality of morphemes has been denied. In this paper, extending the computational models employed in sentence processing to morphological processing, we performed a computational simulation experiment where, given incremental surprisal as a linking hypothesis, five computational models with different representational assumptions were evaluated against human reaction times in visual lexical decision experiments available from the English Lexicon Project (ELP), a ``shared task'' in the morphological processing literature. The simulation experiment demonstrated that (i) ``amorphous'' models without morpheme units underperformed relative to ``morphous'' models, (ii) a computational model with hierarchical syntactic structures, Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar (PCFG), most accurately explained human reaction times, and (iii) this performance was achieved on top of surface frequency effects. These results strongly suggest that morphological processing tracks morphemes incrementally from left to right and parses them into hierarchical syntactic structures, contrary to ``amorphous'' and finite-state models of morphological processing.},

  abstract = {One of the central debates in the cognitive science of language has revolved around the nature of human linguistic competence. Whether syntactic competence should be characterized by abstract hierarchical structures or reduced to surface linear strings has been actively debated, but the nature of morphological competence has been insufficiently appreciated despite the parallel question in the cognitive science literature. In this paper, in order to investigate whether morphological competence should be characterized by abstract hierarchical structures, we conducted a crowdsourced acceptability judgment experiment on morphologically complex words and evaluated five computational models of morphological competence against human acceptability judgments: Character Markov Models (Character), Syllable Markov Models (Syllable), Morpheme Markov Models (Morpheme), Hidden Markov Models (HMM), and Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars (PCFG). Our psycholinguistic experimentation and computational modeling demonstrated that ``morphous'' computational models with morpheme units outperformed ``amorphous'' computational models without morpheme units and, importantly, PCFG with hierarchical structures most accurately explained human acceptability judgments on several evaluation metrics, especially for morphologically complex words with nested morphological structures. Those results strongly suggest that human morphological competence should be characterized by abstract hierarchical structures internally generated by the grammar, not reduced to surface linear strings externally attested in large corpora.},

  abstract = {Two-dimensional maps of individual layers of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in the macaque monkey were constructed and used as a basis for comparing laminar size, shape, and topographic organization. Topographical data from the electrophysiological investigation of the LGN by Malpeli and Baker ('75) were displayed on maps of all six layers. As known from previous studies, there is a significant over-representation of central vision in the LGN. Unexpectedly, though, the visual representation is anisotropic over portions of most LGN layers. That is, the linear magnification factor (millimeters along the laminar surface per degree of visual field) is not equal for all directions from a given point in the visual field. Moreover, the visual representations in the parvicellular and magnocellular divisions of the LGN differ both in their emphasis on central vision and in their anisotropies. To determine the degree of individual variability, laminar maps were prepared from the LGN of seven other hemispheres. The shapes of laminar maps varied considerably between LGNs, from nearly circular to highly elliptical, but the surface area was relatively constant for each layer. Topographical organization, determined by mapping the optic disc representation on the LGN laminae and by labeling from anterograde and retrograde tracer injections in striate cortex, showed significant individual variability. Interestingly, the visual representations in the LGN and striate cortex are topologically inverted with respect to one another. This indicates that the establishment of geniculocortical connections involves a systematic crossing-over of fibers. Information on cell densities and magnification factors in striate cortex obtained from other studies was compared to the results of the present study in order to estimate ratios of cortical neurons to LGN neurons at different eccentricities. The total number of cortical neurons per LGN neuron is about 130 on average, but it extends over approximately a tenfold range, from less than 100 in the far periphery to nearly 1,000 in the fovea. The estimated number of cells in layers 4A and 4C{$\beta$} per parvicellular layer neuron is smaller and extends over a slightly narrower range, from 30 to 240, whereas the number of layer 4C{$\alpha$} neurons per magnocellular neuron varies more widely, from about 45 to 7,000.},

Some neural-network models attempt to explain the neuropsychological and brain-mapping dissociations in terms of single-system associative processing. We show that there are problems in the accounts of homogeneous networks in the light of recent brain-mapping evidence of systematic double-dissociation. We also examine the superior capabilities of more internally differentiated connectionist models, which, under certain conditions, display systematic double-dissociations. It appears that the more differentiation models show, the more easily they account for dissociation patterns, yet without implementing symbolic computations.},

The authors tested the hypothesis that the "face inversion" effect results from the use of holistic shape representations. This suggests that the susceptibility of nonface patterns to inversion should be a function of their degree of part decomposition. In Experiment 1, this was tested and confirmed with dot patterns in which the degree of part decomposition was manipulated by grouping and segregation on the basis of dot color. The hypothesis also predicted that the face inversion effect can be eliminated with face stimuli if participants are induced to recognize the faces in terms of their component parts. In Experiment 2, this was tested and confirmed with whole, intact faces, in which the degree of part decomposition was manipulated by allowing participants to study them, initially, in either whole, intact versions or versions with parts presented separately.},

The response to syntactically anomalous open class words revealed striking qualitative individual differences: These words elicited a P600 response in the majority of subjects and an N400 response in others.

Second, a model is described dealing with the causes and consequences of bias and accuracy in partner and relationship judgments, and research is reviewed showing that partners generally exhibit both positive bias and good levels of tracking accuracy. The roles played by various moderating variables (e.g., relationship stage, individual differences) are also discussed. I conclude that bias in relationship judgments is largely functional and that interactions between partners both shape and are shaped by the directional bias and tracking accuracy attendant in relationship and partner judgments.

When damaged, the network exhibited characteristics that resembled several of the phenomena found in deep dyslexia and semantic-access dyslexia. Damaged networks sometimes settled to the semantic vectors for semantically similar but visually dissimilar words. With severe damage, a forced-choice decision between categories was possible even when the choice of the particular semantic vector within the category was not possible. The damaged networks typically exhibited many mixed visual and semantic errors in which the output corresponded to a word that was both visually and semantically similar. Surprisingly, damage near the output sometimes caused pure visual errors. Indeed, the characteristic error pattern of deep dyslexia occurred with damage to virtually any part of the network.},

Interestingly, this theoretical framework has introduced numerous dimensions to describe semantic features. Recently, we proposed a new parameter to measure the importance of a semantic feature for the conceptual representation\textemdash that is, semantic significance. Here, with speeded verification tasks, we tested the predictive value of our index and investigated the relative roles of conceptual and featural dimensions on the participants' performance. The results showed that semantic significance is a good predictor of participants' verification latencies and suggested that it efficiently captures the salience of a feature for the computation of the meaning of a given concept. Therefore, we suggest that semantic significance can be considered an effective index of the importance of a feature in a given conceptual representation. Moreover, we propose that it may have straightforward implications for feature-based models of semantic memory, as an important additional factor for understanding conceptual representation.

Uppercase words elicited a P300 complex of positivities, whereas agreement violations elicited a late positive shift. These effects differed in their morphology, temporal course, amplitude, and scalp distribution. Manipulations of the probability-of-occurrence and task relevance of the anomalies had robust effects on the response to uppercase words, but not on the response to agreement violations. These anomalies had additive effects when agreement-violating uppercase (doubly anomalous) words were presented. These results indicate that the positive shift elicited by agreement violations is distinct from the P300 response to unexpected, task-relevant anomalies that do not involve the violation of a grammatical rule.

The possibility that changes in neural connectivity underlie the remarkable flexibility of the nervous systems of mammals has therefore not been tested by direct observation. Here, we report studies in which we have visualized the same neurone in the superior cervical ganglion of young adult mice at intervals of up to 33 days. This collection of nerve cells is particularly accessible and therefore well suited to our approach. We find that the dendritic branches of the neurones examined change appreciably over intervals, of 2 weeks or more; some branches retract, others elongate and others seem to form de novo. The apparent remodelling of these postsynaptic elements implies that the synaptic connections of these cells normally undergo significant rearrangement beyond what is usually considered to be the developmental period.},

This paper shows how lack of attention to the very early stages of an EEG preprocessing pipeline can reduce the signal-to-noise ratio and introduce unwanted artifacts into the data, particularly for computations done in single precision. We demonstrate that ordinary average referencing improves the signal-to-noise ratio, but that noisy channels can contaminate the results. We also show that identification of noisy channels depends on the reference and examine the complex interaction of filtering, noisy channel identification, and referencing. We introduce a multi-stage robust referencing scheme to deal with the noisy channel-reference interaction. We propose a standardized early-stage EEG processing pipeline (PREP) and discuss the application of the pipeline to more than 600 EEG datasets. The pipeline includes an automatically generated report for each dataset processed. Users can download the PREP pipeline as a freely available MATLAB library from http://eegstudy.org/prepcode.},

Responses to targets related to the subject NP were faster than those to symantically unrelated targets during passive sentences (gap sentences), but not during active sentences (no-gap sentences), thus indicating that reactivation of the matrix subject did occur in the passive cases.

ERPs from 13 scalp sites were recorded while 20 participants (18-45 yrs old) read a short essay. Some participants made sentence-acceptability judgments at the end of each sentence whereas others read for comprehension without an additional task. ERPs were averaged as a function of word class (open versus closed), grammatical category (articles, nouns, verbs, etc.), and word length. Although the two word classes did elicit distinct ERPs, all of these differences were highly correlated with word length.

Reicher, 1969) and were then probed to make a lexical decision. No frequency effects were observed in the lexical decision task and the significant main effect of frequency found in the subject's analysis of the Reicher task was small and nonmonotonic.

  abstract = {Priming and recollection are expressions of human memory mediated by different brain events. These brain events were monitored while people discriminated words from nonwords. Mean response latencies were shorter for words that appeared in an earlier study phase than for new words. This priming effect was reduced when the letters of words in study-phase presentations were presented individually in succession as opposed to together as complete words. Based on this outcome, visual word-form priming was linked to a brain potential recorded from the scalp over the occipital lobe about 450 ms after word onset. This potential differed from another potential previously associated with recollection, suggesting that distinct operations associated with these two types of memory can be monitored at the precise time that they occur in the human brain.},

The current study investigated whether individual differences in statistical learning (SL), which has been implicated in language acquisition, independently predicted 6- to 8-year-old's comprehension of syntax. Sixty-eight (N = 68) English-speaking children completed a test of comprehension of four syntactic structures, a test of SL utilizing nonlinguistic visual stimuli, and several additional control measures. The results revealed that SL independently predicted comprehension of two syntactic structures that show considerable variability in this age range: passives and object relative clauses. These data suggest that individual differences in children's capacity for SL are associated with the acquisition of the syntax of natural languages.},

In this study, we used a novel regression-based analytic method, which allowed an assessment of the unique contributions of visual properties, including numerosity, to explain visual evoked potentials of participants passively viewing dot arrays. We found that the human brain is uniquely sensitive to numerosity and more sensitive to changes in numerosity than to changes in other visual properties, starting extremely early in the visual stream: 75 ms over a medial occipital site and 180 ms over bilateral occipitoparietal sites. These findings provide strong evidence for the existence of a neural mechanism for rapidly and directly extracting numerosity information in the human visual pathway.},

When morphological facilitation is assessed relative to an orthographically related baseline, suffixed primes facilitate derivationally as well as inflectionally related morphological targets when primes are visual as well as auditory in both the lexical decision and naming tasks.

Robust auditory priming effects were observed for three types of Russian high- and low-frequency inflected verbs with graded regularity treated as complexity and productivity in stem allomorphy in native speakers (NS) of Russian. Similar effects were found in American L2 learners of Russian at three proficiency levels for high-frequency verbs. Low-frequency verbs showed an interaction of the degree of regularity with proficiency level, with priming effects present for regular verbs at all three proficiency levels, semi-regular verbs at two higher levels, and irregular verbs only at the highest level. Lemma and surface frequency effects were observed in irregular verbs only in L2 learners. Results suggest that in Russian, a highly inflected language, auditory lexical access occurs in two stages: first, decomposition into stem and inflectional affix, and second, access of the stem representation at the lemma level, which can occur directly or by further decomposing the stem into root and suffix (the nesting doll pattern). The first stage takes place automatically both in NS and L2 learners for all productive inflections, while the second is gradually acquired by late learners, from productive and less complex to unproductive and more complex stem allomorphy. This developmental tendency is in contrast to the claims that late second language learners store and access regularly inflected words undecomposed and supports the view that L2 learners beyond low proficiency levels process inflectional morphology.},

  abstract = {The amplitude of the N400-an event-related potential (ERP) component linked to meaning processing and initial access to semantic memory-is inversely related to the incremental buildup of semantic context over the course of a sentence. We revisited the nature and scope of this incremental context effect, adopting a word-level linear mixed-effects modeling approach, with the goal of probing the continuous and incremental effects of semantic and syntactic context on multiple aspects of lexical processing during sentence comprehension (i.e., effects of word frequency and orthographic neighborhood). First, we replicated the classic word-position effect at the single-word level: Open-class words showed reductions in N400 amplitude with increasing word position in semantically congruent sentences only. Importantly, we found that accruing sentence context had separable influences on the effects of frequency and neighborhood on the N400. Word frequency effects were reduced with accumulating semantic context. However, orthographic neighborhood was unaffected by accumulating context, showing robust effects on the N400 across all words, even within congruent sentences. Additionally, we found that N400 amplitudes to closed-class words were reduced with incrementally constraining syntactic context in sentences that provided only syntactic constraints. Taken together, our findings indicate that modeling word-level variability in ERPs reveals mechanisms by which different sources of information simultaneously contribute to the unfolding neural dynamics of comprehension.},

This question exemplifies a problem of metacognition: How well do people know their own thoughts? In the study reported here, participants were instructed to imagine a specific visual pattern and rate its vividness, after which they were presented with an ambiguous rivalry display that consisted of the previously imagined pattern plus an orthogonal pattern. On individual trials, higher ratings of vividness predicted a greater likelihood that the imagined pattern would appear dominant when the participant was subsequently presented with the binocular rivalry display. Off-line self-report questionnaires measuring imagery vividness also predicted individual differences in the strength of imagery bias over the entire study. Perceptual bias due to mental imagery could not be attributed to demand characteristics, as no bias was observed on catch-trial presentations of mock rivalry displays. Our findings provide novel evidence that people have a good metacognitive understanding of their own mental imagery and can reliably evaluate the vividness of single episodes of imagination.

In the current experiments, English-learning 8-month-old infants' ability to track transitional probabilities in fluent infant-directed Italian speech was tested (N = 72).

  abstract = {Componential theories of lexical semantics assume that concepts can be represented by sets of features or attributes that are in some sense primitive or basic components of meaning. The binary features used in classical category and prototype theories are problematic in that these features are themselves complex concepts, leaving open the question of what constitutes a primitive feature. The present availability of brain imaging tools has enhanced interest in how concepts are represented in brains, and accumulating evidence supports the claim that these representations are at least partly 'embodied' in the perception, action, and other modal neural systems through which concepts are experienced. In this study we explore the possibility of devising a componential model of semantic representation based entirely on such functional divisions in the human brain. We propose a basic set of approximately 65 experiential attributes based on neurobiological considerations, comprising sensory, motor, spatial, temporal, affective, social, and cognitive experiences. We provide normative data on the salience of each attribute for a large set of English nouns, verbs, and adjectives, and show how these attribute vectors distinguish a priori conceptual categories and capture semantic similarity. Robust quantitative differences between concrete object categories were observed across a large number of attribute dimensions. A within- versus between-category similarity metric showed much greater separation between categories than representations derived from distributional (latent semantic) analysis of text. Cluster analyses were used to explore the similarity structure in the data independent of a priori labels, revealing several novel category distinctions. We discuss how such a representation might deal with various longstanding problems in semantic theory, such as feature selection and weighting, representation of abstract concepts, effects of context on semantic retrieval, and conceptual combination. In contrast to componential models based on verbal features, the proposed representation systematically relates semantic content to large-scale brain networks and biologically plausible accounts of concept acquisition.

  abstract = {(from the chapter) A number of models of lexical access were developed in the past years. The major disagreement between models focuses on the issue of how lexical information is accessed. Does it use a strategy involving decomposing of elements of speech, or are they processed as a unit? No single model has yet been devised to settle such disagreement because both decomposed morphemes and whole words appear to exist in the access to word representation. The conflicting evidence in the literature suggests that hidden factors (e.g., surface frequency and transparency) influence the organization of access representation.  This chapter describes three experiments with 68 college students that were designed to test for factors that influence the organization of access representation in Chinese two-morpheme words. Results confirmed the presence of two factors. However, both interactive-activation models (M. Taft, 1994) and augmented addressed morpheme models (A. Caramazza et al, 1988) as well as other empirical research failed to account for the results. An Inter/Intra Connection model was proposed and adapted to the problem of word processing.

  abstract = {Booij argued recently that the problem of Agentive-Instrumental polysemy among Dutch nominalizations ending in -er can be resolved without resorting to the separation of derivation from affixation (the Separation Hypothesis). He argues for a `semantic extension scheme' whereby an instrumental nominalization like open-er `opener' is explained as a relatively less `agent-like' semantic extension of the category `Agentive': spel-er `player'. This question is only part of the much larger issue of derivational polysemy: why do certain categories, e.g. Agent and Instrumental, tend to receive polysemous marking across languages when others, e.g. Agentive and Action (nominalization), do not. This paper offers an alternate explanation of Booij's problem in a framework which addresses the larger issue. It proposes that the same universal categories, the category functions of traditional grammars, determine both inflectional and derivational relations (Unitary Grammatical Function Hypothesis). Combined with the Separation Hypothesis, unitary grammatical functions can predict (1) which languages are more likely to exhibit polysemy and which, synonymy, and (2) which categories are more or less likely to be shared by a polysemous derivational affix. Even enriched with semantic extension schemes, purely sign-based frameworks make the wrong predictions.},

We find the hypothesis problematic. It ignores the many aspects of grammar that are not recursive, such as phonology, morphology, case, agreement, and many properties of words. It is inconsistent with the anatomy and neural control of the human vocal tract. And it is weakened by experiments suggesting that speech perception cannot be reduced to primate audition, that word learning cannot be reduced to fact learning, and that at least one gene involved in speech and language was evolutionarily selected in the human lineage but is not specific to recursion. The recursion-only claim, we suggest, is motivated by Chomsky's recent approach to syntax, the Minimalist Program, which de-emphasizes the same aspects of language. The approach, however, is sufficiently problematic that it cannot be used to support claims about evolution. We contest related arguments that language is not an adaptation, namely that it is ``perfect,'' non-redundant, unusable in any partial form, and badly designed for communication. The hypothesis that language is a complex adaptation for communication which evolved piecemeal avoids all these problems.},

We tested SL using visually presented stimuli within a triplet learning paradigm and examined reading ability by administering the Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT-4; Wilkinson \& Robertson, 2006). A total of 38 typically developing children (mean age of 9;5 years, range 6;4\textendash 12;5) and 37 healthy adults (mean age of 21 years, range 18\textendash 34) were assessed. In children, SL was significantly related to reading ability. Importantly, this relationship was independent of grade and also age. The adult data, too, revealed that SL was significantly related to reading ability. A regression analysis of the combined child and adult data revealed that SL accounted for a unique amount of variance in reading ability, after age and attention had been taken into consideration. For the first time, this study provides empirical evidence that a capacity for more effective SL is related to higher reading ability in the general population.},

Perfetti (1985) suggested an answer to this question roughly as follows: Although skilled comprehenders differ from less-skilled comprehenders in a number of ways, at least some of these differences arise from a foundational processing factor: the effectiveness of basic word identification skill. Many--not all--problems in comprehension arose from ineffective lower level processes needed for the identification of words. Rapid and perhaps modular word identification was important for a comprehension system of limited capacity. The question we address here is, roughly, does some part of this idea remain tenable? And what more specific instantiation of the general idea is now possible? In what follows, we first review the background of verbal efficiency theory and then illustrate the concept of lexical quality and the lexical quality hypothesis, the central ideas that link lower and higher level reading processes. Then we summarize experiments on simple meaning judgments.},

We examined 2 conflicting principles that may apply to learning grapheme-phoneme-correspondence (GPC) regularities for vowels: (a) variability in irrelevant units may help children derive invariant relationships and (b) similarity between words may force children to use a deeper analysis of lexical structure. We trained 224 first-grade students on a small set of GPC regularities for vowels, embedded in words with either high or low consonant similarity, and tested their generalization to novel tasks and words. Variability offered a consistent benefit over similarity for trained and new words in both trained and new tasks. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {The lexical quality hypothesis (LQH) claims that variation in the quality of word representations has consequences for reading skill, including comprehension. High lexical quality includes well-specified and partly redundant representations of form (orthography and phonology) and flexible representations of meaning, allowing for rapid and reliable meaning retrieval. Low-quality representations lead to specific word-related problems in comprehension. Six lines of research on adult readers demonstrate some of the implications of the LQH. First, large-scale correlational results show the general interdependence of comprehension and lexical skill while identifying disassociations that allow focus on comprehension-specific skill. Second, word-level semantic processing studies show comprehension skill differences in the time course of form-meaning confusions. Studies of rare vocabulary learning using event-related potentials (ERPs) show that, third, skilled comprehenders learn new words more effectively and show stronger ERP indicators for memory of the word learning event and, fourth, suggest skill differences in the stability of orthographic representations. Fifth, ERP markers show comprehension skill differences in meaning processing of ordinary words. Finally, in text reading, ERP results demonstrate momentary difficulties for low-skill comprehenders in integrating a word with the prior text. The studies provide evidence that word-level knowledge has consequences for word meaning processes in comprehension.},

  abstract = {The perceptual recognition of objects is conceptualized to be a process in which the image of the input is segmented at regions of deep concavity into an arrangement of simple geometric components. The fundamental assumption of the proposed theory, recognition-by-components (RBC), is that a modest set of generalized-cone components, called geons, can be derived from contrasts of five readily detectable properties of edges in a two-dimensional image. The detection of these properties is generally invariant over viewing position and image quality and consequently allows robust object perception when the image is projected from a novel viewpoint or is degraded. RBC thus provides a principled account of the heretofore undecided relation between the classic principles of perceptual organization and pattern recognition. The results from experiments on the perception of briefly presented pictures by human observers provide empirical support for the theory.

The 1st word was a trained rare word, an untrained rare word, or an untrained familiar word. Event-related potentials distinguished trained rare words from both untrained rare and familiar words, first at 140 ms and again at 400-600 ms after onset of the 1st word. These results may point to an episodic memory effect. The 2nd word produced an N400 that distinguished trained and familiar word pairs that were related in meaning from unrelated word pairs. Skilled comprehenders learned more words than less skilled comprehenders and showed a stronger episodic memory effect at 400-600 ms on the 1st word and a stronger N400 effect on the 2nd word. These results suggest that superior word learning among skilled comprehenders may arise from a stronger episodic trace that includes orthographic and meaning information and illustrate, how an episodic theory of word identification can explain reading skill.

The `theory of mind' mechanism (ToMM) is part of the core architecture of the human brain, and is specialized for learning about mental states. Impaired development of this mechanism can have drastic effects on social learning, seen most strikingly in the autistic spectrum disorders. ToMM kick-starts belief\textendash desire attribution but effective reasoning about belief contents depends on a process of selection by inhibition. This selection process (SP) develops slowly through the preschool period and well beyond. By modeling the ToMM-SP as mechanisms of selective attention, we have uncovered new empirical phenomena.

The traditional false belief task requires explicit consideration of the agent's subjective perspective on his reasons for action.

To test these hypotheses directly we covaried increases in the nonlinguistic complexity of spoken words [presence or absence of an embedded stem, e.g., claim (clay)] with variations in their linguistic complexity (presence of inflectional affixes, e.g., play+ed). Nonlinguistic complexity, generated by the on-line competition between the full word and its onset-embedded stem, was found to activate both right and left fronto-temporal brain regions, including bilateral BA45 and -47. Linguistic complexity activated left-lateralized inferior frontal areas only, primarily in BA45. This contrast reflects a differentiation between the functional roles of a bilateral system, which supports the basic mapping from sound to lexical meaning, and a language-specific left-lateralized system that supports core decompositional and combinatorial processes invoked by linguistically complex inputs. These differences can be related to the neurobiological foundations of human language and underline the importance of bihemispheric systems in supporting the dynamic processing and interpretation of spoken inputs.

  abstract = {(from the chapter) This chapter discusses the relationship in children between theory of mind and linguistic development, which seems particularly strong for children's mastery of the false-belief test, their syntactic competence in producing complement constructions (using the Index of Productive Syntax), and their memory for complements in statements about mistakes. In particular, this chapter focuses on the concepts of "that" in relation to theory of mind and the conveyance of "want" and desires in the German language. The research presented in this chapter is based on two theories of the relation between language and the theory of mind: Perner, Brandl, and Garnham (2003) analyze perspective problems as problems where the difference between perspectives needs to be confronted and where some representational element must be taken into account in order to maintain a coherent view of the world. J. de Villiers (this volume, chapter 10) makes the same developmental claim by suggesting that around 4 years of age, children acquire Point of View (PoV) markers on particular syntactic elements, and it is the way these markers function that allows children to keep distinct differences in point of view. The findings suggest that for German children's understanding of desire when neither requires complicated finite that-complements (Chinese), both require that-complements (German), or only belief but not desire requires that-complements (English), children understand and talk about desire substantially earlier than belief. The authors' data on German children's production of that-complements showed evidence that "that" has to do with inferring and remembering think-complements. The finding that children understand differences of point of view in the context of conflicting desires at the same time as they understand it with belief raises the question how understanding of point of view can be linked to understanding the that-complements of belief. What "that" has to do with point of view remains a mystery. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (chapter)},

However, implicit learning and statistical learning research favor different interpretations, focusing on the formation of chunks and statistical computations, respectively.

This model builds on the strengths of 2 of the previous models while eliminating their weaknesses. Contrary to the dual-route cascaded model, CDP+ is able to learn and produce graded consistency effects. Contrary to the triangle and the connectionist dual process models, CDP+ accounts for serial effects and has more accurate nonword reading performance. CDP+ also beats all previous models by an order of magnitude when predicting individual item-level variance on large databases. Thus, the authors show that building on existing theories by combining the best features of previous models--a nested modeling strategy that is commonly used in other areas of science but often neglected in psychology--results in better and more powerful computational models.},

Prior to puberty, children exhibit enhanced recognition for adult female faces. With puberty, superior recognition emerges for peer faces that match one's pubertal status. As puberty progresses, so does the peer recognition bias. Adolescents become better at recognizing faces with a pubertal status similar to their own. These findings reconceptualize the adolescent 'dip' in face recognition by showing that it is a recalibration of the face-processing system away from caregivers toward peers. Thus, in addition to preparing the physical body for sexual reproduction, puberty shapes the perceptual system for processing the social world in new ways.

  abstract = {Radial neuron migration in the developing cerebral cortex is a complex journey, starting in the germinal zones and ending in the cortical plate. In mice, migratory distances can reach several hundreds of microns, or millimeters in humans. Along the migratory path, radially migrating neurons slither through cellularly dense and complex territories before they reach their final destination in the cortical plate. This task is facilitated by radial glia, the neural stem cells of the developing cortex. Indeed, radial glia have a unique bipolar morphology, enabling them to serve as guides for neuronal migration. The key guiding structure of radial glia is the basal process, which traverses the entire thickness of the developing cortex. Neurons recognize the basal process as their guide and maintain physical interactions with this structure until the end of migration. Thus, the radial glia basal process plays a key role during radial migration. In this review, we highlight the pathways enabling neuron-basal process interactions during migration, as well as the known mechanisms regulating the morphology of the radial glia basal process. Throughout, we describe how dysregulation of these interactions and of basal process morphology can have profound effects on cortical development, and therefore lead to neurodevelopmental diseases.},

The current authors state that McClelland and Patterson's argument largely hinges on whether the regular past tense is acquired instantaneously and applied perfectly, which they consider to be hallmarks of symbolic models. Gradedness in behavioral data is taken as evidence for the connectionist approach. The authors believe this framing sidesteps the key issue in the past-tense debate: whether human language uses mechanisms that are combinatorial and sensitive to grammatical structure and categories.

One set of proposals questions whether there is decomposition of morphological structure in lexical access, whether complex forms are accessed as whole words, or if there is a competition between these two access modes. Another set of proposals questions whether inflected forms are generated by rule-based systems by connectionist type associative networks or if there is a dual system dissociating rule-based regular inflections from association-based irregular inflections. A central question is whether there are whole-word representations for regularly inflected forms. A series of five lexical decision experiments with 31 undergraduate students addressed this question by looking at whole-word frequency effects across a range of frequency values with constant stem-cluster frequencies. Frequency effects were only found for inflected forms above a threshold of about 6 per million, whereas such effects were found for morphologically simple controls in all frequency ranges. We discuss these data in the context of two kinds of dual models and in relation to competition models proposed within the connectionist literature.

One view holds that morphology is a domain of knowledge with a specific type of neurocognitive representation supported by specific brain mechanisms lateralized to left fronto-temporal cortex. The alternate view characterizes morphological effects as being a by-product of the correlation between form and meaning and where no brain area is predicted to subserve morphological processing per se. Here we provided evidence from Arabic that morphemes do have specific memory traces, which differ as a function of their functional properties. In an MMN study, we showed that the abstract consonantal root, which conveys semantic meaning (similarly to monomorphemic content words in English), elicits an MMN starting from 160 msec after the deviation point, whereas the abstract vocalic word pattern, which plays a range of grammatical roles, elicits an MMN response starting from 250 msec after the deviation point. Topographically, the root MMN has a symmetric fronto-central distribution, whereas the word pattern MMN lateralizes significantly to the left, indicating stronger involvement of left peri-sylvian areas. In languages with rich morphologies, morphemic processing seems to be supported by distinct neural networks, thereby providing evidence for a specific neuronal basis for morphology as part of the cerebral language machinery.},

  abstract = {The vast expressive power of language is made possible by two principles: the arbitrary sound-meaning pairing underlying words, and the discrete combinatorial system underlying grammar. These principles implicate distinct cognitive mechanisms: associative memory and symbol-manipulating rules. The distinction may be seen in the difference between regular inflection (e.g., walk-walked), which is productive and open-ended and hence implicates a rule, and irregular inflection (e.g., come-came, which is idiosyncratic and closed and hence implicates individually memorized words. Nonetheless, two very different theories have attempted to collapse the distinction; generative phonology invokes minor rules to generate irregular as well as regular forms, and connectionism invokes a pattern associator memory to store and retrieve regular as well as irregular forms. I present evidence from three disciplines that supports the traditional word/rule distinction, though with an enriched conception of lexical memory with some of the properties of a pattern-associator. Rules, nonetheless, are distinct from pattern-association, because a rule concatenates a suffix to a symbol for verbs, so it does not require access to memorized verbs or their sound patterns, but applies as the `default', whenever memory access fails. I present a dozen such circumstances, including novel, unusual-sounding, and rootless and headless derived words, in which people inflect the words regularly (explaining quirks like flied out, low-lifes, and Walkmans). A comparison of English to other languages shows that contrary to the connectionist account, default suffixation is not due to numerous regular words reinforcing a pattern in associative memory, but to a memory-independent, symbol-concatenating mental operation.},

We show that this model generalizes to a larger set of suffixes, and we provide independent evidence supporting the claim that a higher rank in the ordering correlates with increased productivity. Behavioral data from lexical decision and word naming show, however, that this model has been one-sided in its exclusive focus on the importance of constituent-driven processing, and that it requires supplementation by a second and equally important focus on the role of memory. Finally, using concepts from graph theory, we show that the space of existing suffix combinations can be conceptualized as a directed graph, which, with surprisingly few exceptions, is acyclic. This acyclicity is hypothesized to be functional for lexical processing.},

In particular, our findings with respect to acquisition of the English binding pattern by native speakers of Serbo-Croatian follow from the theoretical framework we adopt. Current versions of the Binding Theory, including the Relativized SUBJECT analysis, cite morphological complexity as a defining characteristic of reflexives among languages. We argue that Serbo-Croatian speakers (mis)analyze morphologically complex English reflexives as simple, due to transfer from the first language (L1). Participants included 39 adolescent (aged 13-15 yrs) and 34 adult (aged 18-49 yrs) native speakers of Serbo-Croatian and 25 adolescent (aged 13-14 yrs) and 22 adult (aged 18-39 yrs) controls who were native speakers of English. Results indicate that transfer of L1 knowledge of the morphological structure of reflexives may crucially influence the pattern of reflexive interpretation in second language acquisition. This suggests that learners still have access to the principles of Universal Grammar, given that they are able to compute the binding domain as expected, although this domain differs from both the domain in their L1, and the domain in the target language.

A common set of primes and targets, ranging in transparency, were embedded among a larger set of words that were either transparent or opaque, forming 2 artificial languages: a morphologically rich language analogous to Hebrew, and a morphologically impoverished language analogous to English. A network was then trained to map orthography to semantics for either language, and then tested for priming. Both languages yielded morphological priming for the more transparent targets, but priming extended to semantically opaque targets only in the rich language. The results suggest that non-semantic morphological priming, is, in fact, compatible with the connectionist approach but that its occurrence is predicted to depend on the degree of morphological richness of the language.

  abstract = {Eye movements introduce large artifacts to electroencephalographic recordings (EEG) and thus render data analysis difficult or even impossible. Trials contaminated by eye movement and blink artifacts have to be discarded, hence in standard EEG-paradigms subjects are required to fixate on the screen. To overcome this restriction, several correction methods including regression and blind source separation have been proposed. Yet, there is no automated standard procedure established. By simultaneously recording eye movements and 64-channel-EEG during a guided eye movement paradigm, we investigate and review the properties of eye movement artifacts, including corneo-retinal dipole changes, saccadic spike potentials and eyelid artifacts, and study their interrelations during different types of eye- and eyelid movements. In concordance with earlier studies our results confirm that these artifacts arise from different independent sources and that depending on electrode site, gaze direction, and choice of reference these sources contribute differently to the measured signal. We assess the respective implications for artifact correction methods and therefore compare the performance of two prominent approaches, namely linear regression and independent component analysis (ICA). We show and discuss that due to the independence of eye artifact sources, regression-based correction methods inevitably over- or under-correct individual artifact components, while ICA is in principle suited to address such mixtures of different types of artifacts. Finally, we propose an algorithm, which uses eye tracker information to objectively identify eye-artifact related ICA-components (ICs) in an automated manner. In the data presented here, the algorithm performed very similar to human experts when those were given both, the topographies of the ICs and their respective activations in a large amount of trials. Moreover it performed more reliable and almost twice as effective than human experts when those had to base their decision on IC topographies only. Furthermore, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis demonstrated an optimal balance of false positive and false negative at an area under curve (AUC) of more than 0.99. Removing the automatically detected ICs from the data resulted in removal or substantial suppression of ocular artifacts including microsaccadic spike potentials, while the relevant neural signal remained unaffected. In conclusion the present work aims at a better understanding of individual eye movement artifacts, their interrelations and the respective implications for eye artifact correction. Additionally, the proposed ICA-procedure provides a tool for optimized detection and correction of eye movement-related artifact components.},

  abstract = {The traditional account of the acquisition of English verb morphology supposes that a dual architecture underlies the transition from early rote-learning processes (in which past tense forms of verbs are correctly produced) to the systematic treatment of verbs (in which irregular verbs are prone to error). A connectionist account supposes that this transition can occur in a single mechanism (in the form of a neural network) driven by gradual quantitative changes in the size of the training set to which the network is exposed. In this paper, a series of simulations is reported in which a multi-layered perceptron learns to map verb stems to past tense forms analogous to the mappings found in the English past tense system. By expanding the training set in a gradual, incremental fashion and evaluating network performance on both trained and novel verbs at successive points in learning, it is demonstrated that the network undergoes reorganizations that result in a shift from a mode of rote learning to a systematic treatment of verbs. Furthermore, we show that this reorganizational transition is dependent upon the number of regular and irregular verbs in the training set and is sensitive to the phonological sub-regularities characterizing the irregular verbs. The pattern of errors observed is compared to that of children acquiring the English past tense, as well as children's performance on experimental studies with nonsense verbs. It is concluded that a connectionist approach offers a viable alternative account of the acquisition of English verb morphology, given the current state of empirical evidence relating to processes of acquisition in young children.},

Phonological control conditions suggested that differences in formal overlap between prime and target contribute to, but do not account for, this difference, suggesting a link between irregular morphology and semantics. Further analysis dividing the irregular verbs into two categories (weak irregular and strong) revealed that priming for strong verbs was reliably stronger than that for weak irregular and regular verbs, which were statistically indistinguishable from one another.

  abstract = {In an attempt to determine how subjects dealt with four types of logical sentence relationships when a figurative possibility was present, two different experiments were run using a procedure originally developed by Steinberg (1970a). Results indicated that a great many anomalous sentences are readily classified as metaphoric and that individual differences play an important role in the use of these categories. Further analyses revealed that sentences having the order ``The `human' is an `animal' '' were more easily classified as metaphorical than sentences having any other order in the present set of sentences. The findings were discussed in terms of their implications for semantic theory, where it was noted that metaphoric diction makes a purely logical analysis of language exceedingly suspect and that any attempt to define sentence universais must include not only figurative language, but individual differences as well.},

The analyses distinguish morphomic stems, which underlie morphosyntactically distinct word forms, from inflectional stems, which realize tense and mood features and provide the input to regular agreement rules. It is argued that the recognition of these stem types simplifies the description of West Germanic conjugations, supports a general realization-based approach, and suggests a reinterpretation of current realizational models.*}

Results reveal that while bilinguals were slower overall, the inflected items yielded disproportionately longer reaction times in the bilingual group. The derived items, on the other hand, elicited fastest reaction times in both groups. The observed processing cost associated with inflectional morphology indicates that bilingual language background can affect the recognition process for inflected words, possibly by leading to morpheme-based recognition which is slower than full-form recognition. Further studies are needed to examine whether this effect is specific to the language background of our bilinguals or whether it could be a more general processing feature in bilingual speakers faced with regular inflected forms.

  abstract = {Vision unfolds as an intricate pattern of information processing over time. Studying vision and visual cognition therefore requires precise manipulations of the timing of visual stimulus presentation. Although standard computer display technologies offer great accuracy and precision of visual presentation, their temporal resolution is limited. This limitation stems from the fact that the presentation of rendered stimuli has to wait until the next refresh of the computer screen. We present a novel method for presenting visual stimuli with ultrahigh temporal resolution ({$<$}1 ms) on newly available gaming monitors. The method capitalizes on the G-Sync technology, which allows for presenting stimuli as soon as they have been rendered by the computer's graphics card, without having to wait for the next screen refresh. We provide software implementations in the three programming languages C++, Python (using PsychoPy2), and Matlab (using Psychtoolbox3). For all implementations, we confirmed the ultrahigh temporal resolution of visual presentation with external measurements by using a photodiode. Moreover, a psychophysical experiment revealed that the ultrahigh temporal resolution impacts on human visual performance. Specifically, observers' object recognition performance improved over fine-grained increases of object presentation duration in a theoretically predicted way. Taken together, the present study shows that the G-Sync-based presentation method enables researchers to investigate visual processes whose data patterns were concealed by the low temporal resolution of previous technologies. Therefore, this new presentation method may be a valuable tool for experimental psychologists and neuroscientists studying vision and its temporal characteristics.},

We argue that characterization of the development of brain systems (e.g., the default mode network) should be comprehensive, considering not only relationships within a given system, but also how these relationships are situated within wider network contexts. We note that, despite substantial reorganization of functional connectivity, several large-scale network properties appear to be preserved across development, suggesting that functional brain networks, even in children, are organized in manners similar to other complex systems.},

When subjects had to decide whether primes and targets rhymed, non-rhyming words produced greater negativity in the N400 time range than rhyming words. The same effect was obtained when these targets were spoken by another voice than the prime words, suggesting that the effect is determined by phonological factors, and not merely by a physical-acoustic mismatch (Experiment 1). In the rhyming task, the differential N400 for non-rhyming vs. rhyming words was equally pronounced for non-rhyming vs. rhyming non-words (Experiment 2). In a lexical decision task on the same stimuli, a difference between non-rhyming and rhyming targets was obtained for words, but not for non-words (Experiment 3). The results show that the auditory N400 is sensitive to phonological variables. It is further proposed that phonological effects on the auditory N400 are not manifestations unique to phonological processes that demand conscious attention, but may also reflect operations that are performed automatically during auditory word recognition.},

In 2 studies of past-tense morphology, more reliable imageability and frequency effects were found on irregulars than on regulars. An interaction with sex was also observed: Males but not females showed more reliable frequency and imageability effects for irregulars than for regulars; females but not males showed signs of storage for regulars, particularly among higher frequency forms. Overall, the findings validate imageability effects as another diagnostic of storage and suggest that the line between storage and computation is not a simple function; rather, it depends upon the interplay of both item- and subject-specific factors.},

This article proposes that the difference lies in how one thinks about the entity's structure. Object construals require thinking of the structure as being nonarbitrary, whereas substance construals require thinking of the structure as being arbitrary. Six experiments are reported on, providing empirical support for this proposal. Regularity of structure, repetition of structure, and the existence of structure-dependent functions, all of which provide reasons to consider the structure of an entity to be nonarbitrary, were shown to bias participants towards object construals. This paper also discusses how the proposed account of what it means to construe an entity as an object or as some stuff can account for a range of findings in the literature on lexical development. These include the relation between cohesiveness and ontological category, shape and ontological category, and complexity of shape and ontological category. Finally, the nature of construals and the relation of object and substance construals to the physical, design, and intentional stances are discussed.

In the non-task condition, the semantic priming effect was observed in a positive wave with a 200-ms peak latency, P200 (P2). In the semantic matching task, where the subjects were required to decide whether or not the repetition and test Kanji characters were semantically related, the priming effect was obtained as the attenuation of the later negative wave N310 (corresponding to N400) for the related test Kanji, instead of P200. The P200 priming effect was interpreted as the semantically related response at the morphological level, whereas the N310 effect was taken as reflection of the semantic-level activation of the semantic associates with the preceding Kanji. The task dependency of semantic priming levels indicated the top-down control in Kanji recognition processes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2006 APA, all rights reserved).},

This study investigated the neural bases of individual differences during sentence comprehension by examining the network's response to two variations in processing demands: reading sentences containing words of high versus low lexical frequency and having simpler versus more complex syntax. In a functional magnetic resonance imaging study, readers who were independently identified as having high or low working memory capacity for language exhibited three differentiating properties of their language network, namely, neural efficiency, adaptability, and synchronization. First, greater efficiency (defined as a reduction in activation associated with improved performance) was manifested as less activation in the bilateral middle frontal and right lingual gyri in high-capacity readers. Second, increased adaptability was indexed by larger lexical frequency effects in high-capacity readers across bilateral middle frontal, bilateral inferior occipital, and right temporal regions. Third, greater synchronization was observed in high-capacity readers between left temporal and left inferior frontal, left parietal, and right occipital regions. Synchronization interacted with adaptability, such that functional connectivity remained constant or increased with increasing lexical and syntactic demands in high-capacity readers, whereas low-capacity readers either showed no reliable differentiation or a decrease in functional connectivity with increasing demands. These results are among the first to relate multiple cortical network properties to individual differences in reading capacity and suggest a more general framework for understanding the relation between neural function and individual differences in cognitive performance.},

While empathy enables the sharing of others' emotions and may result in empathic distress, a maladaptive form of empathic resonance, or compassion, a feeling of warmth and concern for others, ToM provides cognitive understanding of someone else's thoughts or intentions. These socio-affective and socio-cognitive routes to understanding others are subserved by separable, independent brain networks. Nonetheless they are jointly required in many complex social situations. A process that is critical for both, empathy and ToM, is self-other distinction, which is implemented in different temporoparietal brain regions. Thus, adaptive social behavior is a result of dynamic interplay of socio-affective and socio-cognitive processes.

Some problems were simple, involving inaccessible food \textendash{} bananas vertically or horizontally out of reach, behind a box, and so forth \textendash{} as in the original Kohler problems; others were more complex, involving an actor unable to extricate himself from a locked cage, shivering because of a malfunctioning heater, or unable to play a phonograph because it was unplugged. With each videotape the chimpanzee was given several photographs, one a solution to the problem, such as a stick for the inaccessible bananas, a key for the locked up actor, a lit wick for the malfunctioning heater. The chimpanzee's consistent choice of the correct photographs can be understood by assuming that the animal recognized the videotape as representing a problem, understood the actor's purpose, and chose alternatives compatible with that purpose.},

This allows us to shed light on the factors that characterise income on Twitter and analyse their interplay with user emotions and sentiment, perceived psycho-demographics and language use expressed through the topics of their posts. Our analysis uncovers correlations between different feature categories and income, some of which reflect common belief e.g. higher perceived education and intelligence indicates higher earnings, known differences e.g. gender and age differences, however, others show novel findings e.g. higher income users express more fear and anger, whereas lower income users express more of the time emotion and opinions.},

Through connections with structures of the endocrine and nervous systems, the hypothalamus is able to play an essential role in maintaining homeostasis by integrating signals from the brain and the body. In this chapter, multiple physiological processes regulated by the hypothalamus, including the regulation of food intake, reproduction, body temperature, fluid balance, and blood pressure, will be discussed. Each section will include the primary hypothalamic regions involved in these processes, the neurotransmitter systems integral for these hypothalamic functions, and a discussion of circuitry and pathways that regulate these basic functions.},

Targets were also tested with unrelated word flankers (e.g. book farmer book), and participants made lexical decisions to the central targets. We predicted that truly suffixed word identification would be facilitated by the presence of stem flankers over and above any purely orthographic effects that were expected to be revealed in the pseudo-morphological and non-morphological conditions. We found exactly that pattern and conclude that parallel processing of distinct word identities in the flankers task is modulated by the transparent morphological relations between these words.},

P300 does not appear to be a real-time index of signal (target) selection, since attended low-probability nonsignals also result in P300 and its latency is too long. P300 further appears to be independent of response selection; its latency therefore may or may not correlate with RT, depending on the experimental context. P300 latency does appear to index stimulus evaluation time in that it is not emitted until the stimulus has been cognitively evaluated. P300 amplitude appears sensitive to manipulations of perceptual limited capacity but not sensitive to manipulations of motor limited capacity. It has been proposed that P300's functional role in human information processing is the updating of neurocognitive models concerning future events, although other functions have also been proposed.

In the research presented here, we investigate what information is used to segment a word into its morphemic constituents and, in particular, whether semantic information plays a role in that segmentation. Participants made visual lexical decisions to stem targets preceded by masked primes sharing (1) a semantically transparent morphological relationship with the target (e.g., cleaner-CLEAN), (2) an apparent morphological relationship but no semantic relationship with the target (e.g., corner-CORN), and (3) a nonmorphological form relationship with the target (e.g., brothel-BROTH). Results showed significant and equivalent masked priming effects in cases in which primes and targets appeared to be morphologically related, and priming in these conditions could be distinguished from nonmorphological form priming. We argue that these findings suggest a level of representation at which apparently complex words are decomposed on the basis of their morpho-orthographic properties. Implications of these findings for computational models of reading are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2005 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract).},

  abstract = {How long does it take the human mind to grasp the idea when hearing or reading a sentence? Neurophysiological methods looking directly at the time course of brain activity indexes of comprehension are critical for finding the answer to this question. As the dominant cognitive approaches, models of serial/cascaded and parallel processing, make conflicting predictions on the time course of psycholinguistic information access, they can be tested using neurophysiological brain activation recorded in MEG and EEG experiments. Seriality and cascading of lexical, semantic and syntactic processes receives support from late (latency {$\sim$}1/2 s) sequential neurophysiological responses, especially N400 and P600. However, parallelism is substantiated by early near-simultaneous brain indexes of a range of psycholinguistic processes, up to the level of semantic access and context integration, emerging already 100\textendash 250 ms after critical stimulus information is present. Crucially, however, there are reliable latency differences of 20\textendash 50 ms between early cortical area activations reflecting lexical, semantic and syntactic processes, which are left unexplained by current serial and parallel brain models of language. We here offer a mechanistic model grounded in cortical nerve cell circuits that builds upon neuroanatomical and neurophysiological knowledge and explains both near-simultaneous activations and fine-grained delays. A key concept is that of discrete distributed cortical circuits with specific inter-area topographies. The full activation, or ignition, of specifically distributed binding circuits explains the near-simultaneity of early neurophysiological indexes of lexical, syntactic and semantic processing. Activity spreading within circuits determined by between-area conduction delays accounts for comprehension-related regional activation differences in the millisecond range.},

We have reported an increase in dopamine (DA) release in the MPOA of male rats shortly before and during copulation.

The present study investigated the time courses of restoration, rather than loss, of the MPOA DA response to a receptive female and of copulation in long-term castrates. Male rats were castrated and tested for loss of copulatory ability 21 days later. They then received 2, 5, or 10 daily subcutaneous injections of testosterone propionate (TP, 500 {$\mu$}g) or oil. Microdialysate samples were collected from the MPOA during baseline, exposure to a female behind a barrier, and copulation. Extracellular DA was measured using HPLC\textendash EC. None of the six 2-day-TP-treated animals copulated, nor did they show elevated DA release in the MPOA in the presence of a receptive female. Five of the nine 5-day-TP-treated animals ejaculated; three intromitted without ejaculating; and one failed to copulate, with all but the noncopulating animal showing elevated DA release. All of the six 10-day-TP-treated animals copulated and also demonstrated an increase in MPOA DA. None of the oil controls copulated or showed an increase in DA release. Therefore, a consistent relationship between MPOA DA release during exposure to a receptive female and the subsequent ability of the male to copulate was observed.},

  abstract = {Abstract Both regular inflectional patterns (walk-walked) and irregular ones (swing-swung) can be applied productively to novel words (e.g. wug-wugged; spling -splung). Theories of generative phonology attribute both generalisations to rules; connectionist theories attribute both to analogies in a pattern associator network; hybrid theories attribute regular (fully predictable default) generalisations to a rule and irregular generalisations to a rote memory with pattern-associator properties. In three experiments and three simulations, we observe the process of generalising morphological patterns in humans and two-layer connectionist networks. Replicating Bybee and Moder (1983), we find that people's willingness to generalise from existing irregular verbs to novel ones depends on the global similarity between them (e.g. spling is readily inflectable as splung, but nist is not inflectable as nust). In contrast, generalisability of the regular suffix does not appear to depend on similarity to existing regular verbs Regularly suffixed versions of both common-sounding plip and odd-sounding ploamph were reliably produced and highly rated, and the odd-sounding verbs were not rated as having worse past-tense forms, relative to the naturalness of their stems, than common-sounding ones. In contrast, Rumelhart and McClelland's connectionist past-tense model was found to vary strongly in its tendency to supply both irregular and regular inflections to these novel items as a function of their similarity to forms it was trained on, and for the dissimilar forms, successful regular inflection rarely occurred. We suggest that rule-only theories have trouble explaining patterns of irregular generalisations, whereas single-network theories have trouble explaining regular ones; the computational demands of the two kinds of verbs are different, so a modular system is optimal for handling both simultaneously. Evidence from linguistics and psycholinguistics independently calls for such a hybrid, where irregular pain are stored in a memory system that superimposes phonological forms, fostering generalisation by analogy, and regulars are generated by a default suffix concatenation process capable of operating on any verb, regardless of its sound.},

However, this suggestion is not based on a valid approach to summarizing evidence across studies. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis investigating the effects of selective attention on the C1, involving 47 experiments and 794 subjects in total. Despite heterogeneity across studies, results suggested that attention has a moderate effect on the C1 (Cohen's dz = 0.33, p {$<$} .0001); that is, C1 amplitude is larger for visual stimuli that are attended than unattended. These results suggest that C1 is affected by top-down selective attention.},

  abstract = {It has often been suggested that the role of Broca's region in sentence comprehension can be explained with reference to general cognitive mechanisms (e.g. working memory, cognitive control). However, the (language-related) basis for such proposals is often restricted to findings on English. Here, we argue that an extension of the database to other languages can shed new light on the types of mechanisms that an adequate account of Broca's region should be equipped to deal with. This becomes most readily apparent in the domain of word order variations, which we examined in German verb-final sentences using event-related fMRI. Our results showed that activation in the pars opercularis \textendash{} a core subregion of Broca's area \textendash{} was not only modulated by the relative ordering of subject and object, but also by a further factor known to affect word order in a number of languages, namely referentiality. Notably, the finding provides the first demonstration of a word order-related activation difference within subject-initial sentences in this region. Additional parametric analyses using individual behavioral data as predictors further attest to the independence of the pars opercularis activation from: (a) sentence acceptability, and (b) difficulty in performing the experimental (judgment) task. We argue that these and related findings attest to the need for a processing mechanism that can manipulate predicate-independent, interacting and hierarchically structured relational representations during real time comprehension. These properties pose a challenge to existing accounts of pars opercularis function.},

French third, fifth, and seventh graders and adults (the latter as a control group) performed lexical decision tasks in which targets were preceded by morphological (e.g., tablette\textendash TABLE, ``little table\textendash table''), pseudoderived (e.g., baguette\textendash BAGUE, ``little stick\textendash ring''), orthographic control (e.g., abricot\textendash ABRI, ``apricot\textendash shelter''), and semantic control (e.g., Tulipe\textendash FLEUR, ``tulip\textendash flower'') primes. Across all groups, different patterns of priming were observed in both morphological and orthographic/semantic control conditions, suggesting that they all process morphemes as units when reading. In developing readers, the processing of written morphology is triggered by the form properties of morphemes, and their semantic properties are activated later in the time course of word recognition. In adults, patterns of priming were similar except that the activation of the form properties of morphemes decreased earlier in the time course of word recognition. Taken together, these findings indicate that French developing readers process both the form and meaning properties of morphemes when reading and support a progressive quantitative change in the development of morphological processing over the course of reading development.},

I then summarize the view that the amplitude of the N400 is proportional to difficulty and indexes the efforts deployed by the brain to integrate the meaning of a stimulus in its context. While this view accounts for many literature data, its shortcomings are also pointed out. The need for various inhibition processes is then emphasized together with the idea that integration difficulty may vary with the amount of inhibition to be performed. Consequently, I stress the view that N400 amplitude could index inhibition rather than integration. The fact that, when presented with incongruous sentence endings, subjects are aware of the meanings of both the sentence frame and the ending has an important consequence on this N400 inhibition view. It means that disconfirmed contexts are not inhibited in some conditions, such as when incongruency is relevant in the situation. To account for this fact, the inhibition the N400 could index has to start only once this relevance is coded, that is, at or after the activation of situational representations. We then show that the idea that the N400 reflects such a late inhibition process may account for literature data that are difficult to account for by the integration view. Further studies are thus needed to test this inhibition idea.},

We simulate N400 amplitudes as the change induced by an incoming stimulus in an implicit and probabilistic representation of meaning captured by the hidden unit activation pattern in a neural network model of sentence comprehension, and we propose that the process underlying the N400 also drives implicit learning in the network.

Three experiments, which used a normal (simultaneous) presentation of the letters under 3 different tasks (gender classification, naming, and semantic classification) provided no evidence for sequential processing. Rather, a small advantage in favor of words with late UP was found, which may be interpreted in terms of the lower n-gram frequencies of early-UP words. Exp 4 supported this interpretation and discussed an alternative interpretation in terms of parafoveal preview of the initial letters. A last experiment, which used an incremental presentation of the word letters, gave rise to a UP effect comparable in size to that obtained in an auditory study, suggesting that a temporal distribution of the signal is a sufficient condition for directional processing.},

It examines how these interactions are reflected in linguistic and cognitive theory, considers what they reveal about the operations of language within the mind, and looks at their reflections in expression and communication. Leading international scholars present cutting-edge accounts of developments in the interfaces between phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. They bring to bear a rich variety of methods and theoretical perspectives, focus on a broad array of issues and problems, and illustrate their arguments from a wide range of the world's languages. After the editors' introduction to its structure, scope, and content, the book is divided into four parts. The first, Sound, is concerned with the interfaces between phonetics and phonology, phonology and morphology, and phonology and syntax. Part II, Structure, considers the interactions of syntax with morphology, semantics, and the lexicon, and explores the status of the word and its representional status in the mind. Part III, Meaning, revisits the syntax-semantics interface from the perspective of compositionality, and looks at issues concerned with intonation, discourse, and context. The authors in the final part of the book, General Architectural Concerns, examine work on Universal Grammar, the overall model of language, and linguistic and associated theories of language and cognition. All scholars and advanced students of language will value this book, whether they are in linguistics, cognitive science, philosophy, artificial intelligence, computational science, or informatics.},

As Quine famously pointed out, simply hearing a word in context reveals next to nothing about its meaning. How then do children learn to understand and use words correctly? Here, we show how learning theory can offer an elegant solution to this seemingly intractable puzzle in language acquisition. From it, we derived formal predictions about word learning in situations of Quinean ambiguity, and subsequently tested our predictions on toddlers, undergraduates, and developmental psychologists. The toddlers' performance was consistent both with our predictions and with the workings of implicit mechanisms that can facilitate the learning of meaningful lexical systems. Adults adopted a markedly different and likely suboptimal strategy. These results suggest one explanation for why early word learning can appear baffling: Adult intuitions may be a poor source of insight into how children learn.},

Our contribution to this debate is to report direct behavioral evidence that specific articulatory commands are activated automatically and involuntarily during speech perception. We used electropalatography to measure whether motor information activated from spoken distractors would yield specific distortions on the articulation of printed target syllables. Participants produced target syllables beginning with /k/ or /s/ while listening to the same syllables or to incongruent rhyming syllables beginning with /t/. Tongue,\"A\`ipalate contact for target productions was measured during the articulatory closure of /k/ and during the frication of /s/. Results revealed ,\"A\'utraces,\"A\`u of the incongruent distractors on target productions, with the incongruent /t/-initial distractors inducing greater alveolar contact in the articulation of /k/ and /s/ than the congruent distractors. Two further experiments established that (i) the nature of this interference effect is dependent specifically on the articulatory properties of the spoken distractors; and (ii) this interference effect is unique to spoken distractors and does not arise when distractors are presented in printed form. Results are discussed in terms of a broader emerging framework concerning the relationship between perception and action, whereby the perception of action entails activation of the motor system.

Experiment 1 examined length effects in Serbian when participants were biased to interpret phonologically bivalent stimuli in the alphabet in which they are words or in the alphabet in which they are nonwords (i.e., the visual characteristics of stimuli were held constant across lexical status). Experiment 2 examined length effects in Japanese kana when words were presented in the kana script in which they usually appear or in the script in which they do not normally appear (i.e., the phonological characteristics of stimuli were held constant across lexical status).

The existence of these effects\textemdash along with their theoretical implications\textemdash has, however, been disputed. The authors present three sources of evidence relevant to an assessment of the existence and implications of these effects. First, they present an exhaustive meta-analytic literature review, in which they evaluate the strength of the evidence for masked phonological priming effects on English visual word processing. Second, they present two original experiments that demonstrate a small but significant masked priming effect on English visual lexical decision, which persists in conditions that may discourage phonological recoding. Finally, they assess the theory of visual word recognition offered by the DRC model (Coltheart, Rastle, Perry, Langdon, \&amp; Ziegler, 2001) in the context of their empirical data. Through numerous simulations with this model, they argue that masked phonological priming effects might best be captured by a weak phonological (i.e., dual-access) theory in which lexical decisions are made on the basis of phonological information.},

A heterozygous missense mutation in the KE family causes speech apraxia, involving difficulty producing words with complex learned sequences of syllables. Manipulations in songbirds have helped to elucidate the role of this gene in vocal learning, but findings in non-human mammals have been limited or inconclusive. Here we performed a systematic study of ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) of adult male mice carrying the KE family mutation. Using novel statistical tools, we found that Foxp2 heterozygous mice did not have detectable changes in USV syllable acoustic structure, but produced shorter sequences and did not shift to more complex syntax in social contexts where wildtype animals did. Heterozygous mice also displayed a shift in the position of their rudimentary laryngeal motor cortex layer-5 neurons. Our findings indicate that although mouse USVs are mostly innate, the underlying contributions of FoxP2 to sequencing of vocalizations are conserved with humans.},

  abstract = {A largely overlooked side effect in most studies of morphological priming is a consistent main effect of semantic transparency across priming conditions. That is, participants are faster at recognizing stems from transparent sets (e.g., farm) in comparison to stems from opaque sets (e.g., fruit), regardless of the preceding primes. This suggests that semantic transparency may also be consistently associated with some property of the stem word. We propose that this property might be traced back to the consistency, throughout the lexicon, between the orthographic form of a word and its meaning, here named Orthography-Semantics Consistency (OSC), and that an imbalance in OSC scores might explain the ``stem transparency'' effect. We exploited distributional semantic models to quantitatively characterize OSC, and tested its effect on visual word identification relying on large-scale data taken from the British Lexicon Project (BLP). Results indicated that (a) the ``stem transparency'' effect is solid and reliable, insofar as it holds in BLP lexical decision times (Experiment 1); (b) an imbalance in terms of OSC can account for it (Experiment 2); and (c) more generally, OSC explains variance in a large item sample from the BLP, proving to be an effective predictor in visual word access (Experiment 3).},

Cognitive linguists have since changed their conceptions about the nature of word meanings, and the interplay between words and their contexts. The traditional dividing lines between lexicon and grammar, and linguistic knowledge and encyclopedic knowledge have been largely blurred, and meaning is seen as a manifestation of conceptual structure, which is embodied and entrenched in the schematic network of structures and is extended on the basis of language usage events.

In 2 studies of visual lexical decision, we found that the recognition of stem targets (e.g., depart) was facilitated significantly and equivalently by the prior presentation of semantically transparent (e.g., departure) and semantically opaque (e.g., department) masked primes (using a 52-ms SOA). We found further that the recognition of stem targets (e.g., broth) was faster numerically when these targets were preceded by a morphemically structured semantically opaque masked prime (e.g., brother) than by a nonmorphemically structured masked prime (e.g., brothel). We believe these results implicate the operation of a purely structural morphological segmentation system in early visual word recognition, which may enable the developing reader to capitalize upon higher-level regularities that morphology provides to the mapping between orthography and meaning.

As modern societies rely extensively on literacy skills, and as reading disabilities have profound personal, economic and social consequences, it is surprising that we have a very underdeveloped scientific understanding of the neural basis of reading and visual word recognition in the normal brain. A better understanding of normal reading processes could help individuals with developmental dyslexia and other reading disabilities, and also inform our strategies for improving early learning and carrying out effective interventions. Neuroimaging offers a unique window on reading through which we have achieved profound insights into its neural correlates in both health and disease, and has also raised important questions that have generated much scientific debate. This book addresses some of the fundamental questions in reading research. Piers Cornelissen, Peter Hansen, Morten Kringelbach, and Ken Pugh have brought together some of the leading scientists to provide comprehensive articles that shed light on the neural basis of reading. Its broad-yet-integrative treatment is divided into three parts: 1) behavioural data and modelling (with direct implications for neuroimaging), 2) neuroimaging, and 3) impaired reading. The book will be a useful resource for everyone interested in the reading brain, particularly those in neuroimaging, cognition and attention, sensation and perception, language, development and aging, education, and computational modelling.},

  abstract = {This research investigated the involvement of semantic factors in the processing of morphologically complex words. Lexical decision latencies for unaffixed targets that were immediately preceded by morphologically related primes were examined. The primes were either inflected or derived words (e.g., seemed-seem vs. folder-fold, respectively), which differ in semantic similarity to their targets. Experiment 1 found equivalent priming effects for inflected and derived words, suggesting that factors other than semantic similarity alone mediate the magnitude of morphological priming. Experiment 2 revealed that frequency and semantic transparency interacted in determining the magnitude of morphological priming. Whereas low-frequency inflected and derived primes yielded equivalent levels of priming, high-frequency inflected primes yielded more priming than high-frequency derived primes. Subsequent experiments examined whether this difference in priming can be attributed to differences in semantic similarity. This question was addressed by manipulating variables that influence semantic priming and examining their influence on morphological priming. Experiment 3 demonstrated that both semantic and morphological priming varied as a function of prime-target stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA). At a short SOA (50 ms), semantic priming was unreliable and inflected and derived words gave rise to comparable levels of priming. In contrast, at longer SOAs (150 and 250 ms), semantic priming was found and inflected words yielded more priming than derived words. Moreover, the difference in priming of inflected and derived words increased as SOA increased. Experiment 4 exploited the finding that the effect of semantic relatedness varies in magnitude depending on depth of prime processing. Participants either read the primes (deep processing) or performed a letter search on the primes (shallow processing). This manipulation, however, did not yield the expected effect on the magnitude of semantic priming and hence did not allow a meaningful examination of morphological priming. Taken together, the results suggest that frequency and semantic similarity interactively modulate the magnitude of morphological priming, and by inference, affect the processing of morphologically complex words. The results were interpreted within the connectionist approach to morphological processing, according to which morphological effects reflect the influence of intercorrelations of form and meaning on the dynamics of word recognition.

  abstract = {We summarize some of the most important findings from research evaluating the hypothesized causes of specific reading disability (`dyslexia') over the past four decades. After outlining components of reading ability, we discuss manifest causes of reading difficulties, in terms of deficiencies in component reading skills that might lead to such difficulties. The evidence suggests that inadequate facility in word identification due, in most cases, to more basic deficits in alphabetic coding is the basic cause of difficulties in learning to read. We next discuss hypothesized deficiencies in reading-related cognitive abilities as underlying causes of deficiencies in component reading skills. The evidence in these areas suggests that, in most cases, phonological skills deficiencies associated with phonological coding deficits are the probable causes of the disorder rather than visual, semantic, or syntactic deficits, although reading difficulties in some children may be associated with general language deficits. Hypothesized deficits in general learning abilities (e.g., attention, association learning, cross-modal transfer etc.) and low-level sensory deficits have weak validity as causal factors in specific reading disability. These inferences are, by and large, supported by research evaluating the biological foundations of dyslexia. Finally, evidence is presented in support of the idea that many poor readers are impaired because of inadequate instruction or other experiential factors. This does not mean that biological factors are not relevant, because the brain and environment interact to produce the neural networks that support reading acquisition. We conclude with a discussion of the clinical implications of the research findings, focusing on the need for enhanced instruction.},

In the present experiment, we recorded event-related brain potentials in order to explore possible contextual influences on the activity of this perceptual mechanism. Subjects were first exposed to pairs of small shapes, which did not elicit any face-specific brain activity. The same stimuli, however, elicited face-specific brain activity after subjects saw them embedded in schematic faces, which probably primed the subjects to interpret the shapes as schematic eyes. No face-specific activity was observed when objects rather than faces were used to form the context. We conclude that the activity of face-specific extrastriate perceptual mechanisms can be modulated by contextual constraints that determine the significance of the visual input.},

Subsequent sections review theories of learning to read, the characteristics of children who do not learn to read (i.e., who have developmental dyslexia), research from cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience on skilled reading, and connectionist models of learning to read. The implications of the research findings for learning to read and teaching reading are discussed. Next, the primary methods used to teach reading (phonics and whole language) are summarized. The final section reviews laboratory and classroom studies on teaching reading. From these different sources of evidence, two inescapable conclusions emerge: (a) Mastering the alphabetic principle (that written symbols are associated with phonemes) is essential to becoming proficient in the skill of reading, and (b) methods that teach this principle directly are more effective than those that do not (especially for children who are at risk in some way for having difficulty learning to read). Using whole-language activities to supplement phonics instruction does help make reading fun and meaningful for children, but ultimately, phonics instruction is critically important because it helps beginning readers understand the alphabetic principle and learn new words. Thus, elementary-school teachers who make the alphabetic principle explicit are most effective in helping their students become skilled, independent readers.},

In this study, we used unprimed and masked primed lexical decision to compare truly suffixed (darkest) and pseudosuffixed words (glossary) with within-boundary (drakest/golssary) to across-boundary (darekst/glosasry) letter transpositions. Significant transposed-letter similarity effects were found independently of the morphological position of the letter transposition, demonstrating that, in English, morphologically complex whole-word representations can be directly accessed at initial word processing stages. In a third masked primed lexical decision experiment, the same materials were used in the context of stem target priming, and it was found that truly suffixed primes facilitate the recognition of their stem-target (darkest\textendash DARK) to the same extent as pseudosuffixed primes (glossary\textendash GLOSS), which is consistent with theories of early morpho-orthographic decomposition. Taken together, our findings provide evidence for both whole-word access and morphological decomposition at initial stages of visual word recognition and are discussed in the context of a hybrid account.

By contrast, his ability fo convert print to sound at the segmental level is remarkably spared. He showed no difficulty in reading nonwords and those words to which stress may be assigned on the basis of syllabic structure. In reading aloud words with lexically assigned stress (but not words with syllabically assigned stress), however, CLB produced a large number of segmentally correct, but suprasegmentally incorrect responses (e.g. sabato (Saturday) \textrightarrow{} /sa'bato/ instead of /'sabato/). Since his ability to use orthographic information in lexical decision and in comprehension tasks was only very mildly impaired, his stress assignment errors would seem to be the result of damage to the phonological output lexicon. This pattern of performance is interpreted as support for the hypothesis that the phonological representations computed in speech production do not merely consist of ordered sequences of phonemes, but consist instead of multidimensional representations that specify (among other things) syllabic structure.},

  abstract = {It is hypothesized that creole languages are largely invented by children and show fundamental similarities, which derive from a biological program for language. The structures of Hawaiian Pidgin and Hawaiian Creole are contrasted, and evidence is provided to show that the latter derived from the former in a single generation. A realistic model of the processes of Creole formation shows how several specific historical and demographic factors interacted to restrict, in varying degrees, the access of pidgin speakers to the dominant language, and hence the nature of input to the children of those speakers. It is shown that the resulting similarities of Creole languages derive from a single grammar with a restricted list of categories and operations. However, grammars of individual Creoles will differ from this grammar to a varying extent: The degree of difference will correlate very closely with the quantity of dominant-language input, which in turn is controlled by extralinguistic factors. Alternative explanations of the above phenomena are surveyed, in particular, substratum theory and monogenesis: Both are found inadequate to account for the facts. Primary acquisition is examined in light of the general hypothesis, and it is suggested that the bioprogram provides a skeletal model of language which the child can then readily convert into the target language. Cases of systematic error and precocious learning provide indirect support for the hypothesis. Some conjectures are made concerning the evolutionary origins of the bioprogram and what study of Creoles and related topics might reveal about language origins.},

We further show that there are simple learning devices, such as neural networks, capable of exploiting such statistical cues, producing a bias toward correct AUX questions when compared to their ungrammatical counterparts. The results suggest that the basic assumptions of the poverty of stimulus argument may need to be reappraised. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

We find evidence for the parallel access to full-forms and morphological constituents diagnosed by the early effects of compound frequency, as well as early effects of left constituent frequency and family size. We also observe an interaction between compound frequency and both the left and the right constituent family sizes. Furthermore, our data show that suffixes embedded in the derived left constituent of a compound are efficiently used for establishing the boundary between compounds' constituents. The success of segmentation of a compound is demonstrably modulated by the affixal salience of the embedded suffixes. We discuss implications of these findings for current models of morphological processing and propose a new model that views morphemes, combinations of morphemes and morphological paradigms as probabilistic sources of information that are interactively used in recognition of complex words.},

The current study was designed to examine whether or not individual and developmental differences exist in the interactivity of certain visual word recognition processes. Specifically, using a mediated priming paradigm (see Reimer, Brown, \& Lorsbach, 2001), two experiments were conducted to determine whether or not the influence of semantic processing on orthographic and phonological processing depends on perceptual ability and age. Third grade, sixth grade, and adult participants were tested. Orthographically mediated inhibition effects were found only with high perceptual ability readers, regardless of age. Furthermore, phonologically mediated inhibition effects were found only with young children. Based on these results, an IA account of the Context x Age/Reading Skill interaction was developed, as well as an IA account of developmental and individual differences in mediated priming. The results of the present study suggest that the interactivity of certain visual word recognition processes change as reading skill improves across development.

According to a recent variant of comparison theory, novel metaphors must be processed as comparisons; only conventional metaphors can be processed as categorizations. We argue that choice of process is determined not by conventionality, but instead by the semantic and referential properties of the metaphor itself. We identified a type of novel metaphor that is indeed understood more quickly as a comparison than as a categorization. We then generated variants of such metaphors to make comparison difficult and found that these new novel metaphors were understood more quickly as categorizations than as comparisons. We conclude that metaphors can be processed as categorizations from the start, depending on their semantic and referential properties.},

The results indicate strong developmental trends in both the mastery of derivational morphology and the spelling of derived words; however, spelling performances lagged significantly behind the ability to generate the same words. Success generating and spelling derived words depended on the complexity of transformations between base and derived forms. Further, mastery of phonological and orthographic transformations most strongly distinguished the three grades in both spelling and generating derived words. Indications that the older students were using knowledge of morphemic structure in spelling derived words were found in analysis of the spelling of base and derived word pairs and the application of suffix addition rules.},

In this paper we evaluate, as candidate clinical markers,          a set of morphemes that mark Tense. In English, this includes -s third person singular, -ed regular past, BE, and DO. According to the Extended Optional Infinitive Account (EOI) of Rice, Wexler, and          Cleave (1995), this set of morphemes is likely to appear optionally in the grammars          of children with SLI at a rate lower than the optionality evident in younger controls.          Three groups of preschool children participated: 37 children with SLI, and two control          groups, one of 40 MLU-equivalent children and another of 45 age-equivalent children.          Three kinds of evidence support the conclusion that a set of morphemes that marks          Tense can be considered a clinical marker: (a) low levels of accuracy for the target          morphemes for the SLI group relative to either of the two control groups; (b) affectedness          for the set of morphemes defined by the linguistic function of Tense, but not for          morphemes unrelated to Tense; and (c) a bimodal distribution for Tense-marking morphemes          relative to age peers, in which the typical children are at essentially adult levels          of the grammar, whereas children in the SLI group were at low (i.e., non-adultlike)          levels of performance. The clinical symptoms are evident in omissions of surface forms.          Errors of subject-verb agreement and syntactic misuses are rare, showing that, as          predicted, children in an EOI stage who are likely to mark Tense optionally at the          same time know a great deal about the grammatical properties of finiteness and agreement          in the adult grammar. The findings are discussed in terms of alternative accounts          of the grammatical limitations of children with SLI and implications for clinical          identification.},

However, Gold's results do not apply under the rather common assumption that language presentation may be modeled as a stochastic process. Indeed, Elman (Elman, J.L., 1993. Learning and development in neural networks: the importance of starting small. Cognition 48, 71\textendash 99) demonstrated that a simple recurrent connectionist network could learn an artificial grammar with some of the complexities of English, including embedded clauses, based on performing a word prediction task within a stochastic environment. However, the network was successful only when either embedded sentences were initially withheld and only later introduced gradually, or when the network itself was given initially limited memory which only gradually improved. This finding has been taken as support for Newport's `less is more' proposal, that child language acquisition may be aided rather than hindered by limited cognitive resources. The current article reports on connectionist simulations which indicate, to the contrary, that starting with simplified inputs or limited memory is not necessary in training recurrent networks to learn pseudo-natural languages; in fact, such restrictions hinder acquisition as the languages are made more English-like by the introduction of semantic as well as syntactic constraints. We suggest that, under a statistical model of the language environment, Gold's theorem and the possible lack of explicit negative evidence do not implicate innate, linguistic-specific mechanisms. Furthermore, our simulations indicate that special teaching methods or maturational constraints may be unnecessary in learning the structure of natural language.},

For the first grade children, awareness of noun morphology uniquely contributed to word reading, and none of the morphological tasks were uniquely associated with spelling. In grade 6, derivational morphology contributed both to reading and spelling achievement, whereas awareness of verb inflection uniquely explained spelling only. Lexical compounding did not uniquely contribute to literacy skills in either grade.

The implication that the duration and timing of the context in which a letter occurs should greatly influence the perceptibility of the target is confirmed by 9 experiments with 128 undergraduates, demonstrating that early or enhanced presentations of word and pronounceable-pseudoword contexts greatly increased the perceptibility of target letters. According to the model, letters in strings that share several letters with words should be equally perceptible whether they are orthographically regular and pronounceable (SLET) or irregular (SLNT) and should be much more perceptible than letters in contexts that share few letters with any word (XLQJ). The prediction was tested and confirmed. Overall results are accounted for, with some modification of parameters, although there are some discrepancies in detail. Several recent findings that seem to challenge the model are considered, and a number of extensions are proposed. (34 ref)},

If it is due to generic expertise, as opposed to having some innate component, holistic processing should be learnable for stimuli other than upright faces. Here we assess inverted faces. We trained subjects to discriminate identical twins using up to 1100 exposures to each twin in different poses and images. In the upright orientation, twin discrimination was supported by holistic processing. Removal of a single face feature had no effect on performance, and a composite effect (Young, A. W., Hellawell, D., \&amp; Hay, D.C. (1987). Configurational information in face perception. Perception 16 (6), 747\textendash 759) was obtained. In the inverted orientation, however, above chance identification ability relied on (a) image specific learning, or (b) tiny local feature differences not noticed in the upright faces. The failure to learn holistic processing for inverted faces indicates that, in contrast to the situation for objects (Tarr, M.J., \&amp; Pinker, S. (1989). Mental rotation and orientation-dependence in shape recognition. Cognitive Psychology 21 (2), 233\textendash 282), orientation specificity of face processing is highly stable against practice.},

Experiment 1 examined the immediate memory for briefly presented chess positions from master games in players from a wide range of abilities, following the imposition of various secondary tasks designed to block separate components of working memory. Suppression of the articulatory loop (by preventing subvocal rehearsal) had no effect on measures of recall, whereas blocking the visuospatial sketchpad (by manipulation of a keypad) and blocking the central executive (by random letter generation) had equivalent disruptive effects, in comparison with a control condition. Experiment 2 investigated the effects of similar secondary tasks on the solution (i.e., move selection) of tactical chess positions, and a similar pattern was found, except that blocking the central executive was much more disruptive than in Experiment 1. Experiment 3 compared performance on two types of primary task, one concerned with solving chess positions as in Experiment 2, and the other a sentence-rearrangement task. The secondary tasks in each case were both designed to block the central executive, but one was verbal (vocal generation of random numbers), while the other was spatial in nature (random generation of keypresses). Performance of the spatial secondary task was affected to a greater extent by the chess primary task than by the verbal primary task, whereas there were no differential effects on these secondary tasks by the verbal primary task. In none of the three experiments were there any differential effects between weak and strong players. These results are interpreted in the context of the workingmemory model and previous theories of the nature of cognition in chess.},

In related neuropsychological work, Ullman et al. (1997) proposed a dual-route model for past tense processing, in which the lexicon (used for access to irregularly inflected forms) corresponds to declarative memory and a medial temporal/ parietal circuit, and the rule system (used for computation of regularly inflected forms) corresponds to procedural memory and a frontal (including Broca's area)/basal ganglia circuit. We used functional MRI and a memory encoding task to test this model for derivationally suffixed words, comparing those words that show evidence of decompositional processing in behavioral studies (-ness, -less, and -able words) with derived words that do not show decomposition effects (-ity and -ation words). By examining Broca's area and the basal ganglia as regions of interest, we found that "decomposable" derived and inflected words showed increases in activity relative to nondecomposable suffixed words. Results support a dual-route model of lexical access of complex words that is consistent with the Ullman et al. proposal.},

Two different subsystems of German inflection were studied, participial inflection and noun plurals. For participial forms, L2 learners were found to widely generalize the -t suffixation rule in a nonce-word elicitation task, and in the event-related brain potential experiment, they showed an anterior negativity followed by a P600--both results resembling previous findings from native speakers of German on the same materials. For plural formation, the L2 learners displayed different preference patterns for regular and irregular forms in an off-line plural judgment task. Regular and irregular plural forms also differed clearly with regard to their brain responses. Whereas overapplications of the -s plural rule produced a P600 component, overapplications of irregular patterns elicited an N400. In contrast to native speakers of German, however, the L2 learners did not show an anterior negativity for -s plural overapplications. Taken together, the results show clear dissociations between regular and irregular inflection for both morphological subsystems. We argue that the two processing routes posited by dual-mechanism models of inflection (lexical storage and morphological decomposition) are also employed by L2 learners.

They argued that these data implicate rule-based serial processing, and they also reported a successful simulation with a model that has a rule-based serial al component-the DRC model of reading aloud (Coltheart, Rastle, Perry, Langdon, \& Ziegler, 200 1). However, Zorzi (2000) also simulated these data with a model that operates solely in parallel. Furthermore, Kwantes and Mewhort (1999) simulated these data with a serial processing model that has no rules for converting orthography to phonology. The human data reported by Rastle and Coltheart therefore neither require a serial processing account, nor successfully discriminate among a number of computational models of reading aloud. New data are presented wherein an interaction between the effects of regularity and serial position of irregularity is again reported for human readers...

We contrast the ambiguity seen in words like bark, which have multiple unrelated meanings, with words that have multiple related word senses (e.g., twist). In all three experiments we find that while multiple word senses do produce faster responses, ambiguity between multiple meanings delays recognition. These results suggest that, while competition between the multiple meanings of ambiguous words delays their recognition, the rich semantic representations associated with words with many senses facilitate their recognition.},

In contrast, for visual word recognition, there is little evidence that the meanings of visually similar words are activated in parallel. This is consistent with the idea that for reading (in contrast to listening), since all the sensory information necessary to identify a word is available at once, any competition between visually similar words is resolved before their meanings are retrieved. However, Forster and Hector (2002) have recently shown that for nonwords (e.g.,turple), some aspect of the meanings of lexical neighbors (e.g.,turtle) can be activated. However, this finding is limited to nonwords. The activation ofturtle's meaning in response toturple may occur becauseturple has no meaning. In normal reading, we do not encounter nonwords, and there is strong pressure on the reading system to produce meaningful representations for every word (even misspelled words). The two semantic categorization experiments reported here extend this finding to real words. Participants are slower to decide thatleotard is not an animal because of its animal neighborleopard. This shows that information about a word's meaning can be available before it has been uniquely recognized.},

In the first of 2 experiments with 14 native Spanish speakers (aged 20-30 yrs), the prime and the target shared the same stem form, whereas in the second condition, the prime contained a marked (alternated) stem. A reduced N400 was found for unmarked (nonalternated) stems in the primed condition, whereas marked stems showed no such effect. Moreover, control conditions demonstrated that the surface form properties (i.e., the different degree of phonetic and orthographic overlap between primes and targets) do not explain the observed priming difference. The ERP priming effect for verb forms with unmarked stems in Spanish is parallel to that found for regularly inflected verb forms in English and German. We argue that effective priming is possible because prime target pairs access the same lexical entry for their stems. By contrast, verb forms with alternated stems constitute separate lexical entries, and are therefore less powerful primes for their corresponding base forms.

Several of the chapters in the work concentrate on the interface between different aspects of linguistic theory or the boundaries between linguistic theory and other disciplines. Thus in both its scope and in its approach the Survey is a unique and fundamental work of reference. It undoubtedly fulfils the editor's principal aim of providing a wealth of information, insight and ideas that will excite and challenge all readers with an interest in linguistics.},

  abstract = {People are generally faster and more accurate to name or categorize objects at the basic level (e.g., dog) relative to more general (animal) or specific (collie) levels, an effect replicated in Experiment 1 for categorization of object pictures. To some, this pattern suggests a dual-process mechanism, in which objects first activate basic-level categories directly and later engage more general or specific categories through the spread of activation in a processing hierarchy. This account is, however, challenged by data from Experiment 2 showing that neuropsychological patients with impairments of conceptual knowledge categorize more accurately at superordinate levels than at the basic level--suggesting that knowledge about an object's general nature does not depend on prior basic-level categorization. The authors consider how a parallel distributed processing theory of conceptual knowledge can reconcile the apparent discrepancy. This theory predicts that if healthy individuals are encouraged to make rapid categorization responses, the usual basic {$>$} general advantage should also reverse, a prediction tested and confirmed in Experiment 3. Implications for theories of visual object recognition are discussed.},

In Exp I, norms for the internal structure of 10 categories were collected. In Exps II, III, and IV, internal structure was found to affect the perceptual encoding of physically identical pairs of stimuli, facilitating responses to physically identical good members and hindering responses to identical poor members of a category. Exps V and VI showed that the category name did not generate a physical code (e.g., lines or angles), but rather affected perception of the stimuli at the level of meaning. Exps VII and VIII showed that while the representation of the category name which affected perception contained a depth meaning common to words and pictures which enabled Ss to prepare for either stimulus form within 700 msec, selective reduction of the interval between prime and stimulus below 700 msec revealed differentiation of the coding of meaning in preparation for actual perception. Exp IX suggested that good examples of semantic categories are not physiologically determined, as the effects of the internal structure of semantic categories on priming (unlike the effects for color categories) could be eliminated by long practice.

In probabilistic terms, the hypothesis is that prototypicality is a function of the total cue validity of the attributes of items. In Exps I and III, Ss listed attributes for members of semantic categories which had been previously rated for degree of prototypicality. High positive correlations were obtained between those ratings and the extent of distribution of an item's attributes among the other items of the category. In Exps II and IV, Ss listed superordinates of category members and listed attributes of members of contrasting categories. Negative correlations were obtained between prototypicality and superordinates other than the category in question and between prototypicality and an item's possession of attributes possessed by members of contrasting categories. Exps V and VI used artificial categories and showed that family resemblance within categories and lack of overlap of elements with contrasting categories were correlated with ease of learning, reaction time in identifying an item after learning, and rating of prototypicality of an item. It is argued that family resemblance offers an alternative to criterial features in defining categories. (36 ref)},

Researchers recently suggested that a shared mental model (SMM) among team members may help them to make successful decisions. Several avenues for developing SMMs in teams exist, one of which is planning. We explored the relationship between team planning, SMMs, and coordinated team decision making and performance. Results indicated that effective planning increased the SMM among team members, allowed them to utilize efficient communication strategies during high-workload conditions, and resulted in improved coordinated team performance. In addition, the communication strategy alone affected the degree of coordinated performance attained by teams during periods of increased workload. Implications of these results and team functioning are discussed. Actual or potential applications of this research include performance and training in settings that require interdependent actions among operators.},

Twenty-eight subjects were engaged in a lexical decision task. The target item (a legal word or a pseudo word) was always preceded by a prime consisting of a sentence fragment that provided a particular context. With respect to the prime a word target could be either a correct completion, a violation of a semantic selection restriction, or a violation of a syntactic subcategorization rule. An N400-like wave was elicited by both types of deviations. Syntactic anomalies evoked a negative shift predominantly over the anterior scalp with a preponderance over the left hemisphere, while semantic anomalies were accompanied by a much more widespread negativity with the maximum over posterior temporal areas. The amplitude of the semantic vie lation effect was found to be related to the strength of the priming constraints. The topographic difference is consistent with the idea that syntactic and semantic aspects of comprehension are handled by different neural subsystems.},

Methods Electronic health records from Kaiser Permanente health plans in Georgia and Northern and Southern California were used to identify TGNB individuals, who sought care from January 2006 to December 2014, and the data were analyzed by year, site, age, and sex assigned at birth. Results In 2006, the number of TGNB people (and corresponding 95\% CI) per 100 000 population were 3.5 (1.9, 6.3) in Georgia, 5.5 (4.8, 6.4) in Southern California, and 17 (16, 19) in Northern California. In 2014, these frequencies increased to 38 (32, 45), 44 (42, 46), and 75 (72, 78) per 100 000 population, respectively. When analyzed by age, the most rapid increase was observed among persons 18 to 25 years old, and this increase accelerated after 2010. The ratio of transmasculine to transfeminine persons also changed from 1:1.7 in 2006 to 1:1 in 2014 overall and from 1:1 in 2006 to 1.8:1 in 2014 among persons {$<$}18 years of age. Conclusion This analysis confirms previous observations that the proportion of TGNB people is growing, especially among young adults. The composition of the TGNB population is also changing from predominantly transfeminine to roughly 1:1 overall and to predominantly transmasculine in children and adolescents.},

The event-related brain potential (ERP) pattern of acoustically presented sentences containing two syntactic anomalies (word category and subject\textendash verb agreement) was compared to the ERP response to sentences containing a single violation. The ERPs for the agreement violation revealed a left anterior negativity (LAN) indicating the detection of the morphosyntactic error, followed by a P600 reflecting processes of reanalysis. The ERPs for both the category and the combined violation showed an early negativity reflecting processes of phrase structure building, followed by a P600 indicating syntactic reanalysis. Additionally, a broadly distributed negativity following the early negativity and preceding the P600 was observed. This ERP component is suggested to reflect reference specification processes arising from the specific sentence structure used in the present study. The ERP pattern for the combined violation suggests no additivity or interaction between the two syntactic anomalies in the early time windows (early negativity, reference-related negativity, and LAN), whereas interactive effects are observed in a late time range (P600).},

The network is trained to produce the plurals and past tense forms of a large corpus of monosyllabic English nouns and verbs. The developmental trajectory of network performance is analyzed in detail and is shown to mimic a number of important features of the acquisition of English noun and verb morphology in young children. These include an initial error-free period of performance on both nouns and verbs followed by a period of intermittent over-regularization of irregular nouns and verbs. Errors in the model show evidence of phonological conditioning and frequency effects. Furthermore, the network demonstrates a strong tendency to regularize denominal verbs and deverbal nouns and masters the principles of voicing assimilation. Despite their incorporation into a single-system network, nouns and verbs exhibit some important differences in their profiles of acquisition. Most importantly, noun inflections are acquired earlier than verb inflections. The simulations generate several empirical predictions that can be used to evaluate further the suitability of this type of cognitive architecture in the domain of inflectional morphology.},

Third, inference with the model is Bayesian and provides a principled and efficient means of pooling information across disparate data from different individuals. Because the model efficiently pools information across individuals, it is particularly well suited for those common cases in which the researcher collects a limited number of observations from several participants. Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the hierarchical Bayesian model provides more accurate estimates than several popular competitors do.

A conspicuous N170 was recorded for both face categories. Pictures of animal faces were associated with a N170 of similar amplitude compared to pictures of human faces, but with delayed peak latency. Picture inversion enhanced N170 amplitude for human faces and delayed its peak for both human and animal faces. Finally, whether processed as targets or non-targets, depending on the task, both human and animal face N170 were identical. Thus, human faces in natural scenes elicit a clear but non-specific N170 that is not modulated by task status. What appears to be specific to human faces is the strength of the inversion effect.},

Results also showed that irregularly related primes do not facilitate recognition of the target by participants with DLL These results were interpreted as indicating that words are not organized according to "morphological families' in the DLI mental lexicon, but rather according to a principle of frequency, and supported the hypothesis that words in the DLI mental lexicon lack lexical features and morphological structure.

  abstract = {Modern Hebrew exhibits a non-concatenative morphology of consonantal ``roots'' and melodic ``templates'' that is typical of Semitic languages. Even though this kind of non-concatenative morphology is well known, it is only partly understood. In particular, theories differ in what counts as a morpheme: the root, the template, both, or neither. Accordingly, theories differ as to what representations learners must posit and what processes generate the eventual surface forms. In this paper I present a theory of morphology and allomorphy that combines lexical roots with syntactic functional heads, improving on previous analyses of root-and-pattern morphology. Verbal templates are here argued to emerge from the combination of syntactic elements, constrained by the general phonology of the language, rather than from some inherent difference between Semitic morphology and that of other languages. This way of generating morphological structure fleshes out a theory of morphophonological alternations that are non-adjacent on the surface but are local underlyingly; with these tools it is possible to identify where lexical exceptionality shows its effects and how it is reined in by the grammar. The Semitic root is thus analogous to lexical roots in other languages, storing idiosyncratic phonological and semantic information but respecting the syntactic structure in which it is embedded.},

Here we used event-related brain potentials (ERPs) to investigate semantic, morphological and formal (orthographic) processing conjointly in a masked priming paradigm. We directly compared morphological to both semantic and formal/orthographic priming (shared letters) on verbs. Masked priming was used to reduce strategic effects related to prime perception and to suppress semantic priming effects. The three types of priming led to distinct ERP and behavioral patterns: semantic priming was not found, while formal and morphological priming resulted in diverging ERP patterns. These results are consistent with models of lexical processing that make reference to morphological structure. We discuss how they fit in with the existing literature and how unresolved issues could be addressed in further studies.

It states that each utterance in a coherent discourse segment contains a single semantic entity\textemdash the backward-looking center\textemdash that provides a link to the previous utterance, and an ordered set of entities\textemdash the forward-looking centers\textemdash that offer potential links to the next utterance. We report five reading-time experiments that test predictions of this theory with respect to the conditions under which it is preferable to realize (refer to) on entity using a pronoun rather thon o repeated definite description or name. The experiments show that there is a single backward-looking center that is preferentially realized as a pronoun, and that the backward-looking center is typically realized as the grammatical subject of the utterance. They also provide evidence that there is a set of forward-looking centers that is ranked in terms of prominence, and that a key factor in determining prominence\textemdash surface-initial position\textemdash does not affect determination of the backward-looking center. This provides evidence for the dissociation of the coherence processes of looking backward and looking forward.},

Morphological complexity of a word affects recognition time when subjects are responding to predominately prefixed stimuli but not when responding to mostly single-morpheme stimuli. The discrepancies between our data and earlier studies are discussed, and it is suggested that morphological decomposition may be a special strategy induced by the overrepresentation of multimorphemic stimuli.

It now provides a choice of interface; users can write scripts in Python if they choose, while those who prefer to construct experiments graphically can use the new Builder interface. Here we describe the features that have been added over the last 10 years of its development. The most notable addition has been that Builder interface, allowing users to create studies with minimal or no programming, while also allowing the insertion of Python code for maximal flexibility. We also present some of the other new features, including further stimulus options, asynchronous time-stamped hardware polling, and better support for open science and reproducibility. Tens of thousands of users now launch PsychoPy every month, and more than 90 people have contributed to the code. We discuss the current state of the project, as well as plans for the future.},

Many, it seems, have assumed that appropriate physical conditions and a positive psychosocial environment could adequately nurture intuitive expressive solutions. With a growing acceptance of discipline-based art education and artistry as intellectual activity, theoreticians and practitioners have started to question whether alternative methods, such as direct instruction, might enhance creativity and develop complex thinking skills. The answer is relative to how creative behaviour is defined, but there is a large body of research suggesting that studio problem-solving skills can be improved with practice and guidance. Selected findings are reviewed in this article, along with many field-tested exercises, to suggest how theory might be translated into practice.

Results indicate that reaction times (RTs) were faster to both the 2nd member of associated pairs (targets) and repeated words, with the latter facilitatory effect being more than twice that of the former. ERPs to the semantic primes were more negative-going than those to targets. This difference peaked around 400-450 msec after stimulus onset. Comparison of unrepeated and repeated words revealed a larger and temporally more extended difference, with a similar scalp topography. The prime-target differences are interpreted as a further example of the sensitivity of the N400 component of the ERP to semantic relationships between words. The differences between the repetition and priming effects in ERPs are considered equivocal with respect to the view that the associated behavioral effects are caused by different cognitive mechanisms.

The neuroconstructivist approach differs in several respects: (i) it seeks more indirect, lower-level causes of abnormality than impaired cognitive modules; (ii)modules are thought to emerge from a developmental process of modularization; (iii) unlike empiricism, neuroconstructivism accepts some form of innately specified starting points, but unlike nativism, these are considered to be initially `domain-relevant', only becoming domain-specific with the process of development and specific environmental interactions; and (iv) different cognitive disorders are considered to lie on a continuum rather than to be truly specific. These alternative theoretical positions are briefly considered as they apply to Specific Language Impairment, and followed by a more detailed case study of a well-defined neurodevelopmental disorder, Williams syndrome. It is argued that development itself plays a crucial role in phenotypical outcomes.},

In a word definition task, children from both grades performed overall better on derived words than on monomorphemic words. However, the results were modified by the factors Frequency and Productivity. Most strikingly, performance on monomorphemic words was disproportionately weaker than on derived words at the low frequency range. At the high-frequency range, derived words with low-productive suffixes yielded poorest performance. We partly make an appeal to the lexical-statistical properties of the Finnish language to explain the interaction of Frequency and Word Structure. At any rate, the results suggest that Finnish elementary school children benefit significantly from utilizing morphology in determining word meanings.},

  abstract = {We tested current models of morphological processing in reading with data from four visual lexical decision experiments using German compounds and monomorphemic words. Triplets of two semantically transparent noun-noun compounds and one monomorphemic noun were used in Experiments 1a and 1b. Stimuli within a triplet were matched for full-form frequency. The frequency of the compounds' constituents was varied. The compounds of a triplet shared one constituent, while the frequency of the unshared constituent was either high or low, but always higher than full-form frequency. Reactions were faster to compounds with high-frequency constituents than to compounds with low-frequency constituents, while the latter did not differ from the monomorphemic words. This pattern was not influenced by task difficulty, induced by the type of pseudocompounds used. Pseudocompounds were either created by altering letters of an existing compound (easy pseudocompound, Experiment 1a) or by combining two free morphemes into a non-existing, but morphologically legal, compound (difficult pseudocompound, Experiment 1b). In Experiments 2a and 2b, frequency-matched pairs of semantically opaque noun-noun compounds and simple nouns were tested. In Experiment 2a, with easy pseudocompounds (of the same type as in Experiment 1a), a reaction-time advantage for compounds over monomorphemic words was again observed. This advantage disappeared in Experiment 2b, where difficult pseudocompounds were used. Although a dual-route might account for the data, the findings are best understood in terms of decomposition of low-frequency complex words prior to lexical access, followed by processing costs due to the recombination of morphemes for meaning access. These processing costs vary as a function of intrinsic factors such as semantic transparency, or external factors such as the difficulty of the experimental task.

Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded from 3 midline sites and from left and right inferior parietal sites. The peak latency of a late positive component, P637, covaried with RT, with variations in latency of around half the corresponding RT variations. The peak-to-peak amplitude of N100-P187 interacted with stimulus and task, such that it was larger for nonwords in the REAL task and words in the REAL/PSEUD task. The P637 latency data support a model of RT variation based on the interaction of changes in parallel response preparation and stimulus evaluation processes. The observations with respect to N100-P187 suggest that ERPs are sensitive to factors related to the early processing of words and wordlike visual material.

Some words were repetitions, either within- or across-modality, of words presented six items previously. Visual-visual repetition evoked a sustained positive shift, which onset around 250 msec and comprised two topographically and temporally distinct components. Auditory-visual repetition modulated only the later of these two components. For auditory EMS, within- and across-modality repetition evoked effects with similar onset latencies. The within-modality effect was initially the larger, but only at posterior sites. In Experiment 2, critical items were auditory and visual nonwords, and target items were auditory words and visual pseudohomophones. Visual-visual nonword repetition effects onset around 450 msec, and demonstrated a more anterior scalp distribution than those evoked by auditory-visual repetition. Visual-auditory repetition evoked only a small, late-onsetting effect, whereas auditory-auditory repetition evoked an effect that, at parietal sites only, was almost equivalent to that from the analogous condition of Experiment 1. These findings indicate that, as indexed by ERF's, repetition effects both within- and across-modality are influenced by lexical status.

Making the distinction between metaphoric and ``anomalous'' expressions is subject to wide variation in judgment, yet humans agree that some potentially metaphoric expressions are much more comprehensible than others. In the context of a program which interprets simple isolated sentences that are potential instances of cross-modal and other verbal metaphor, I consider some possible coherence criteria which must be satisfied for an expression to be ``conceivable'' metaphorically. Metaphoric constraints on object nominals are represented as abstracted or extended along with the invariant structural components of the verb meaning in a metaphor. This approach distinguishes what is preserved in metaphoric extension from that which is ``violated'', thus referring to both ``similarity'' and ``dissimilarity'' views of metaphor. The role and potential limits of represented abstracted properties and constraints is discussed as they relate to the recognition of incoherent semantic combinations and the rejection or adjustment of metaphoric interpretations.},

We showed that with semantically compositional ("transparent") words, priming obtained whether the prime was the first or the second constituent. However, when the constituents were not semantically compositional ("opaque"), lexical access was only facilitated when the prime was the first constituent of the word, contradicting the decomposition view. This result was extended in Experiment 2 using a bilingual variation of the same paradigm - the prime was an English word associate of the first or second constituent of a two-character Chinese word. The results also contradicted the predictions of the decomposition hypothesis. In the third experiment, we manipulated cohort size of the first and second constituent, and showed that whereas cohort size modulated access for transparent words, it had no effect for opaque words. The results were explained with a cohort model which hypothesizes that bimorphemic words are represented as a whole. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2005 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract).},

The learner might be further aided by language-specific prosodic cues correlated with word boundaries. As a first step in testing these hypotheses, we briefly exposed adults to an artificial language in which the only cues available for word segmentation were the transitional probabilities between syllables. Subjects were able to learn the words of this language. Furthermore, the addition of certain prosodic cues served to enhance performance. These results suggest that distributional cues may play an important role in the initial word segmentation of language learners.},

Online measures of language processing, however, are known to be influenced by factors such as lexical association that are distinct from\textemdash but often confounded with\textemdash expectancy. An open question therefore is whether a specific locus of expectancy related effects can be established in neural and behavioral processing correlates. We address this question in an event-related potential experiment and a self-paced reading experiment that independently cross expectancy and lexical association in a context manipulation design. We find that event-related potentials reveal that the N400 is sensitive to both expectancy and lexical association, while the P600 is modulated only by expectancy. Reading times, in turn, reveal effects of both association and expectancy in the first spillover region, followed by effects of expectancy alone in the second spillover region. These findings are consistent with the Retrieval-Integration account of language comprehension, according to which lexical retrieval (N400) is facilitated for words that are both expected and associated, whereas integration difficulty (P600) will be greater for unexpected words alone. Further, an exploratory analysis suggests that the P600 is not merely sensitive to expectancy violations, but rather, that there is a continuous relation. Taken together, these results suggest that the P600, like reading times, may reflect a meaning-centric notion of Surprisal in language comprehension.},

Results showed that the N170 distinguished between faces and nonface stimuli when the concept of a face was clearly rendered by the visual stimulus, but it did not distinguish among different face types: Even a schematic face made from simple line fragments triggered the N170. However, in a second experiment, inversion seemed to have a different effect on natural faces in which face components were available and on the pure gestalt-based schematic faces: The N170 amplitude was enhanced when natural faces were presented upside down but reduced when schematic faces were inverted. Inversion delayed the N170 peak latency for both natural and schematic faces. Together, these results suggest that early face processing in the human brain is subserved by a multiple-component neural system in which both whole-face configurations and face parts are processed. The relative involvement of the two perceptual processes is probably determined by whether the physiognomic value of the stimuli depends upon holistic configuration, or whether the individual components can be associated with faces even when presented outside the face context.},

Moreover, while both phonological and morphological awareness in English predicted independent unique variance in English word reading, only phonological awareness in Arabic predicted Arabic word reading. Complex-word reading fluency was predicted by morphological awareness within both languages.

We found that most dyslexic children showed a phonological deficit, either in terms of response accuracy (92.1\% of the sample), speed (84.8\%), or both (79.3\%). Deficits in visual attention span, as measured by partial report ability, affected 28.1\% of dyslexic participants, all of which also showed a phonological deficit. Visual stress, as measured by subjective reports of visual discomfort, affected 5.5\% of dyslexic participants, not more than controls (8.5\%). Although phonological variables explained a large amount of variance in literacy skills, visual variables did not explain any additional variance. Finally, children with comorbid phonological and visual deficits did not show more severe reading disability than children with a pure phonological deficit. These results (a) confirm the importance of phonological deficits in dyslexia; (b) suggest that visual attention span may play a role, but a minor one, at least in this population; (c) do not support any involvement of visual stress in dyslexia. Among the factors that may explain some differences with previously published studies, the present sample is characterized by very stringent inclusion criteria, in terms of the severity of reading disability and in terms of exclusion of comorbidities. This may exacerbate the role of phonological deficits to the detriment of other factors playing a role in reading acquisition. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

Codification (i.e., the development of a single memory code that can be triggered even by fragmented input information) explains the faster and more accurate identification of words than pseudowords. The present studies traced the development and retention of such codes for repeated pseudowords and examined the growth and loss of the repetition effect for both pseudowords and words. After approximately 5 prior occurrences, words and pseudowords were identified equally accurately in 2 types of threshold identification tasks, suggesting that codification had been completed for pseudowords. Although the initial word advantage disappeared, the accuracy of identification still increased with repetitions. The facilitation caused by repetition was not affected much by spacing within a session, but it dropped from day to day and disappeared after a delay of 1 yr. Results suggest an episodic basis for the repetition effect. After 1 yr, performance was equal for old pseudowords and new and old words: All these levels were superior to that for new pseudowords, suggesting that the learned codes for pseudowords are as strong and permanent as the codes for words. A model of identification is presented in which feedback from old codes and episodic images in memory facilitates better processing.

This ability, however, is constrained by age of acquisition (AoA); that is, the age at which learning occurs significantly affects the outcome. This is most clearly reflected in domains such as language, music, and athletics. This article provides a perspective on the neural and computational mechanisms underlying AoA in language acquisition. The authors show how AoA modulates both monolingual lexical processing and bilingual language acquisition. They consider the conditions under which syntactic processing and semantic processing may be differentially sensitive to AoA effects in second-language acquisition. The authors conclude that AoA effects are pervasive and that the neural and computational mechanisms underlying learning and sensorimotor integration provide a general account of these effects.

This book contains 15 chapters revolving around an experimental paradigm about a child subject involved in a false belief task involving a puppet and a hidden toy. The toy is hidden under the child's watch with the puppet out of site and then when the child is asked where the puppet will look for the toy when it returns. Autistic children will more than likely say that the puppet will look for the toy in its current location instead of where it would be from the puppet's perspective. This is how the author explains theory of mind and the rest of the chapters revolve around this. Many variables are examined, such as the mother's amount of use of mental verbs when interacting with her child, her emphasis on "that" sentence structure, socioeconomic status (interestingly coming up only in a chapter examining the effect of genetic variables), twin versus single status, monozygotic versus dizygotic twin status, various forms of psychopathology or disability as already mentioned, and the effect of training. The reviewer concludes that as thorough as this book is in reviewing the majority of studies of theory of mind and its relation to language conceptualization, inclusion of a behavioral approach as an antidote to the vagueness of the theory of mind metaphor in a future review of this area will do much to elucidate this research.

  abstract = {Language comprehension involves coping with ambiguity and recovering from misanalysis. Syntactic ambiguity resolution is associated with increased reading times, a classic finding that has shaped theories of sentence processing. However, reaction times conflate the time it takes a process to complete with the quality of the behavior-related information available to the system. We therefore used the speed-accuracy tradeoff procedure (SAT) to derive orthogonal estimates of processing time and interpretation accuracy, and tested whether stronger retrieval cues (via semantic relatedness: neighed-{$>$} horse vs. fell-{$>$} horse) aid interpretation during recovery. On average, ambiguous sentences took 250ms longer (SAT rate) to interpret than unambiguous controls, demonstrating veridical differences in processing time. Retrieval cues more strongly related to the true subject always increased accuracy, regardless of ambiguity. These findings are consistent with a language processing architecture where cue-driven operations give rise to interpretation, and wherein diagnostic cues aid retrieval, regardless of parsing difficulty or structural uncertainty.

  abstract = {(from the chapter) One of the main issues addressed in bilingual research has been how bilinguals represent and access the words from their two languages. Studies carried out in different languages suggest that the distinction between cognate (words that are similar in form and meaning) and noncognate (words only similar in meaning) translations can be relevant in determining how words are represented in the bilingual lexicon. In the present chapter, we review a program of research in which we examined the visual recognition of these two types of translations in Spanish-English and Catalan-Spanish bilinguals in experiments using the priming paradigm and the lexical decision task. These experiments showed on the one hand that facilitation effects are only obtained with cognate translations and on the other that these effects cannot be the result of mere form and/or meaning similarity. The latter also seems to hold for morphological priming effects within a language. On the other hand, they showed that cognate facilitation effects do not differ from those obtained with morphologically related words both within and between languages. On the basis of this evidence, we propose that cognate words are represented differently from other words related across languages (either by form or meaning), and that this representation can be characterized in morphological terms. The implications of these data for models of bilingual word recognition are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (chapter)},

The input reflected the ``rules'' for marking categories of gendered nouns, without making participants explicitly aware of the nature of what they were to learn. Participants were scanned while listening to a series of gender-marked nouns during four sequential scans, and were tested for their learning immediately after each scan. Although participants were not told the nature of the learning task, they exhibited learning after their initial exposure to the stimuli. Independent component analysis of the brain data revealed five task-related sub-networks. Unlike prior statistical learning studies of word segmentation, this morphological learning task robustly activated the inferior frontal gyrus during the learning period. This region was represented in multiple independent components, suggesting it functions as a network hub for this type of learning. Moreover, the results suggest that subnetworks activated by statistical learning are driven by the nature of the input, rather than reflecting a general statistical learning system.},

  abstract = {A conceptual analysis is made of several ways in which the morphological structure of words might enter their lexical representation and/or processing. Economising on storage space seems an attractive option in light of the linguistic definition of the morpheme. However, for several word types, problems would arise in the mapping of morphs onto morphemes and of morphemic meanings onto whole-word meanings. Moreover, economy is a legal option, which might not be available to the mental lexicon. Alternatively, morphs might be put to the purpose of increasing lexical access speed, as proposed by Taft and Forster (1975) in their prefix-stripping model. It is demonstrated that such a view strips morphology from virtually all of its linguistic aspects. Furthermore, the prefix-stripping model would decrease rather than increase the access speed for several types of prefixed words in a number of languages. Linguistically interesting hypotheses are instantiated by the view that affixes are used for providing the syntactic processor with structural information and by the proposal that morphologically organised representational structures are the result of an encoding/retrieval scheme developed at the time of lexical acquisition/learning. Finally, morphemic units might be involved in processing as the result of the frequency of their letter cluster. It is a remarkable fact in current psycholinguistic research on morphology that, despite the linguistic nature of the study object, the majority of studies addressing it have been concerned with access representations rather than intra-lexical, linguistically relevant representations.},

The studies reported here establish for the first time that a region in the human temporo-parietal junction (here called the TPJ-M) is involved specifically in reasoning about the contents of another person's mind. First, the TPJ-M was doubly dissociated from the nearby extrastriate body area (EBA; Downing et al., 2001). Second, the TPJ-M does not respond to false representations in non-social control stories. Third, the BOLD response in the TPJ-M bilaterally was higher when subjects read stories about a character's mental states, compared with stories that described people in physical detail, which did not differ from stories about nonhuman objects. Thus, the role of the TPJ-M in understanding other people appears to be specific to reasoning about the content of mental states.},

This generalization holds both at the affix level and the word level. At the affix level, this maxim, when combined with an understanding of the role of frequency and phonotactics in morphological processing, can account for the patterns generally attributed to level ordering. At the word level, it can explain the so-called dual-level behavior of some affixes?anaffix may resist attaching to a complex word that is highly decomposable but be acceptable whenit attaches to a comparable complex word that favors the direct access route in speech perception. Only a parsing account can afford this set of phenomena a unified explanation.* INTRODUCTION. One of the most debated problems of English morphology is that of stacking restrictions amongst derivational affixes. Of the many potential combinations of affixes, only a very small proportion are actually attested. Many attempts to account for apparent restrictions on affix ordering have invoked some form of the AFFIX-ORDERING GENERALIZATION (Siegel 1979). The basic claim of the affix-ordering generalization is that affixes can be divided into two sets: level 1 and level 2. Level 1 affixation occurs prior to level 2 affixation, and so no level 1 affix can attach outside of any level 2 affix (hence *-ness-ic, *-less-ity,andsoon). I argue here that early accounts of affix ordering were overly restrictive and drew the line at the wrong level of abstraction. But more recent work, which has discarded the idea that there are any restrictions on ordering (beyond selectional restrictions), misses a number of important generalizations. Many facts about English stacking restrictions can be predicted if we reduce the problem to one of parsability. This can capture not only the range of generalizations about English stacking restrictions but also a large number of systematic, word-based exceptions to these generalizations. Inapaperwidelycitedasresponsiblefordisprovingtheaffix-orderinggeneralization, Fabb(1988)arguesagainstastratificationalapproachtoaffixordering.Hedemonstrates that the affix-ordering generalization fails to rule out a large number of affix combinations,whichnonethelessdonotoccur.Hearguesthataffixorderingisconstrainedonly by selectional restrictions: all but a few non-occurring pairs of suffixes can be ruled out solely by a combination of selectional restrictions, of which one of the most extensive in its effects is a restriction against attachment to an already suffixed word. (Fabb 1988:538) One of Fabb?s observations, then, is that there seem to be a large number of affixes that do not attach to already affixed words. This observation, I argue, holds the key to understanding restrictions on affix ordering in English. Many affixes are sensitive to internal structure in potential bases. While some affixes basically tolerate no internal structure,otherswilltoleratestructuretosomeminimumdegree.Thedegreeofinternal *Thisarticleisbasedonchapter9ofmyNorthwesternUniversitydissertation(Hay2000).Forcomments anddiscussionsI amgratefultoHarald Baayen,MaryBeckman,Andrew Carstairs-McCarthy,BrianJoseph, Chris Kennedy, Janet Pierrehumbert, Ingo Plag, Lance Rips, two anonymous referees, and audiences at NorthwesternUniversity, VictoriaUniversity ofWellington, andthe affixordering workshopat MaxPlanck Institute, Nijmegen. 527 LANGUAGE, VOLUME 78, NUMBER 3, (2002)528 structure tolerated by an affix is not determined by selectional restrictions, but, rather, by how much structure that affix itself creates.

Very little is known about the aetiology of premature ejaculation. This analysis shows that many PE patients have a heightened penile sensitivity. This information could result in the design and development of new drugs. OBJECTIVES To investigate the correlation between penile hypersensitivity and premature ejaculation (PE), as defined by the criteria identified by the International Society of Sexual Medicine (ISSM). Penile hypersensitivity as a cause of PE is based on historical clinical neurophysiological data and clinical efficacy of the topical desensitizing agent PSD502 in the treatment of PE. PSD502 is a eutectic-like mixture of two local anaesthetics, lidocaine and prilocaine, whose primary action is to reduce neuronal conduction in sensory afferents. METHODS Historical neurophysiological data was reviewed, together with data from the recent PSD502 clinical trials, including the first published double-blind clinical trial data evaluating a topical desensitizing agent in a population of men with PE, as per the new ISSM definition. The clinical profile of PSD502, based on its local anaesthetic properties, is used as a surrogate index of the role of sensory afferents in the ejaculatory reflex. RESULTS The published data does not support unequivocally penile hypersensitivity as the cause of PE. Interpretation of the data is hampered by the variability of the populations described as having PE across studies. Data from the PSD502 clinical trials clearly shows that PSD502 increases ejaculatory latency, and improves control and sexual satisfaction when applied topically to men with PE 5 min before intercourse, enabling subjects to delay ejaculation up to six times longer than those who used a placebo. CONCLUSION The clinical profile of PSD502 lends credibility to the penile hypersensitivity hypothesis for PE. The predominant action of local anaesthetics is to reduce neuronal firing in sensory afferents; the clinical profile of PSD502, which shows improvement of ejaculatory function in the absence of a generalized reduction in penile sensitivity, can most readily be explained based on an underlying hypersensitivity in patients with PE.},

  abstract = {Usage of the term `theory of mind' (ToM) has exploded across fields ranging from developmental psychology to social neuroscience and psychiatry research. However, its meaning is often vague and inconsistent, its biological bases are a subject of debate, and the methods used to study it are highly heterogeneous. Most crucially, its original definition does not permit easy downward translation to more basic processes such as those studied by behavioral neuroscience, leaving the interpretation of neuroimaging results opaque. We argue for a reformulation of ToM through a systematic two-stage approach, beginning with a deconstruction of the construct into a comprehensive set of basic component processes, followed by a complementary reconstruction from which a scientifically tractable concept of ToM can be recovered.},

Exp 2 investigated the influence of semantic biases on ambiguity resolution and found that 3 probabilistic factors influenced lexical category ambiguity resolution.

They noted that this priming effect was smaller for balanced bilinguals than for less proficient bilinguals, although the interaction failed to reach significance. Findings of Gollan, Forster, and Frost (1997) suggest that this could be attributed to a greater reliance on phonology in L2 reading, caused by a smaller proficiency in this language. However, in this study we show that the Dutch-French cross-lingual phonological priming effect is equally large for perfectly balanced and less proficient bilinguals.

Activity in left IFG decreased during repetition conditions that reduced competition but increased during repetition conditions that increased competition; this pattern was contrasted to repetition effects observed in other cortical areas, specifically regions of left temporal cortex. The increase in left IFG activity, which is not predicted by a simple semantic retrieval account of prefrontal function, is consistent with the hypothesis that left IFG subserves the selection of semantic knowledge among competing alternatives.},

The derivational task was found to be harder than the inflectional task, both on the stem and the suffix level, attributable to its higher semantic opacity. In both oral tests, correct stem production when suffixed was related to the morphophonological level of stem change. Correlations were found between morphological and writing scores. Moreover, children who were more advanced in morphology in kindergarten progressed more in writing vowels from kindergarten to first grade, and those who were more advanced in writing in kindergarten improved more in derivational morphology with grade.

To understand the mechanisms of this effect, we used event-related potential and behavioral measures in a longitudinal design. Seventy-four Mandarin-speaking children aged 4\textendash 5 y old were pseudorandomly assigned to piano training, reading training, or a no-contact control group. Six months of piano training improved behavioral auditory word discrimination in general as well as word discrimination based on vowels compared with the controls. The reading group yielded similar trends. However, the piano group demonstrated unique advantages over the reading and control groups in consonant-based word discrimination and in enhanced positive mismatch responses (pMMRs) to lexical tone and musical pitch changes. The improved word discrimination based on consonants correlated with the enhancements in musical pitch pMMRs among the children in the piano group. In contrast, all three groups improved equally on general cognitive measures, including tests of IQ, working memory, and attention. The results suggest strengthened common sound processing across domains as an important mechanism underlying the benefits of musical training on language processing. In addition, although we failed to find far-transfer effects of musical training to general cognition, the near-transfer effects to speech perception establish the potential for musical training to help children improve their language skills. Piano training was not inferior to reading training on direct tests of language function, and it even seemed superior to reading training in enhancing consonant discrimination.},

A definitive answer to this question has been elusive because of the continuous distribution of reading performance and predictors of dyslexia and because of the heterogeneous nature of samples of poor readers. Samples of poor readers are a mixture of individuals whose reading is consistent with or expected based on their performance in other academic areas and in language, and individuals with dyslexia whose reading is not consistent with or expected based on their other performances. In the present article, we replicate and extend a new approach for determining the prevalence of dyslexia. Using model-based meta-analysis and simulation, three main results were found. First, the prevalence of dyslexia is better represented as a distribution that varies as a function of severity as opposed to any single-point estimate. Second, samples of poor readers will contain more expected poor readers than unexpected or dyslexic readers. Third, individuals with dyslexia can be found across the reading spectrum as opposed to only at the lower tail of reading performance. These results have implications for screening and identification, and for recruiting participants for scientific studies of dyslexia.},

In these landmark volumes, leading researchers across a range of disciplines provide a state-of-the-art view of imitation, integrating the latest findings and theories with reviews of seminal work, and revealing why imitation is a topic of such intense current scientific interest. Perspectives are drawn from neuroscience and brain imaging, animal and developmental psychology, primatology, ethology, philosophy, anthropology, media studies, economics, sociology, education, and law. These volumes provide a resource that makes this research accessible across disciplines and clarifies its importance for the social sciences and philosophy as well as for the cognitive sciences. As a further aid to cross-fertilization, each volume includes extensive interdisciplinary commentary and discussion.The first volume considers possible mechanisms of imitation, including discussion of mirror systems, ideomotor and common coding theories, and the possibility of "shared circuits" for control, imitation, and simulation, and then takes up imitation in animals, with illuminating comparisons to human imitation. The second volume focuses first on the roles of imitation in human development and in learning to understand the minds of others, and then on the broader social and cultural roles and functions of imitation, including discussions of meme theory and cultural evolution, and of the pervasive imitative tendencies of normal adults and their relevance for understanding the effects of the media on human behavior.},

This pattern provides evidence against the position that all inflectional variants of a given stem share one entry in the mental lexicon. Data strongly suggest that it can be misleading to take full priming of a stem by its morphological relatives as sufficient evidence for there being lexical entries shared by all morphological relatives. In Exp 2, similar asymmetries were obtained for derived forms. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2002 APA, all rights reserved).},

In semantics, distributional approaches posit that similarity between words can be derived from regularities of the contexts in which they appear. Here, we study how regularities in written text impact readers' knowledge about orthography: Can similarity between characters be learned from the written environment? Adapting methods from distributional semantics, we model the contextual similarity among alphanumeric characters in a large text corpus. We find modest correlations between model-derived similarities with similarity derived from a behavioral experiment. Beyond this result, model-derived similarity from neural embedding models captures key aspects of orthographic knowledge, like case, letter identity and consonant\textendash vowel status. We conclude that the text environment contains regularities that are relevant to readers and that statistical learning is a promising way for this information to be acquired. More broadly, our results imply that statistical regularities are relevant not only at the level of word semantics but also individual written characters.},

  abstract = {Autism is a severe developmental disorder marked by a triad of deficits, including impairments in reciprocal social interaction, delays in early language and communication, and the presence of restrictive, repetitive and stereotyped behaviors. In this review, it is argued that the search for the neurobiological bases of the autism spectrum disorders should focus on the social deficits, as they alone are specific to autism and they are likely to be most informative with respect to modeling the pathophysiology of the disorder. Many recent studies have documented the difficulties persons with an autism spectrum disorder have accurately perceiving facial identity and facial expressions. This behavioral literature on face perception abnormalities in autism is reviewed and integrated with the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) literature in this area, and a heuristic model of the pathophysiology of autism is presented. This model posits an early developmental failure in autism involving the amygdala, with a cascading influence on the development of cortical areas that mediate social perception in the visual domain, specifically the fusiform ``face area'' of the ventral temporal lobe. Moreover, there are now some provocative data to suggest that visual perceptual areas of the ventral temporal pathway are also involved in important ways in representations of the semantic attributes of people, social knowledge and social cognition. Social perception and social cognition are postulated as normally linked during development such that growth in social perceptual skills during childhood provides important scaffolding for social skill development. It is argued that the development of face perception and social cognitive skills are supported by the amygdala\textendash fusiform system, and that deficits in this network are instrumental in causing autism.},

In the preoptic area, the major site controlling male sexual behavior, estradiol increases the level of the COX-2 enzyme and its product, prostaglandin E2 which promotes dendritic spine synaptogenesis. In the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus, the major site controlling female reproductive behavior, estradiol promotes glutamate release from synaptic terminals, activating NMDA receptors and the MAP Kinase pathway. In the arcuate nucleus, a major regulator of anterior pituitary function, estradiol increases GABA synthesis, altering the morphology of neighboring astrocytes and reducing formation of dendritic spines synapses. Glutamate, GABA and the importance of neuronal-astrocytic cross talk are emerging as common aspects of masculinization. Advances are also being made in the mechanistic basis of female brain development, although the challenges are far greater.},

The Talairach coordinates of activation in first language processing were very similar to that of second language processing in the high proficient bilinguals. However, in the low proficient group, the activation clusters were generally smaller and distributed over wider areas in both the hemispheres than the clusters identified in the ALE maps from the high proficient group.

Participants watched a classic inattentional blindness video (Simons \& Chabris, 1999) and were instructed to count passes among basketball players, wherein 58\% noticed the unexpected: a person wearing a gorilla suit. When participants were accurate with their pass counts, individuals with higher working memory capacity were more likely to report seeing the gorilla (67\%) than those with lesser working memory capacity (36\%).

Emphasis is placed on the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the amygdala as two key components of this circuitry. Emotion guides action and organizes behavior towards salient goals. To accomplish this, it is essential that the organism have a means of representing affect in the absence of immediate elicitors. It is proposed that the PFC plays a crucial role in affective working memory. The ventromedial sector of the PFC is most directly involved in the representation of elementary positive and negative emotional states while the dorsolateral PFC may be involved in the representation of the goal states towards which these elementary positive and negative states are directed. The amygdala has been consistently identified as playing a crucial role in both the perception of emotional cues and the production of emotional responses, with some evidence suggesting that it is particularly involved with fear-related negative affect. Individual differences in amygdala activation are implicated in dispositional affective styles and increased reactivity to negative incentives. The ventral striatum, anterior cingulate and insular cortex also provide unique contributions to emotional processing.},

The mechanisms involved in these modifications appear to be radically different depending on whether primes are unmasked and identifiable, or whether they are masked and difficult to report.

Whereas some theorists propose that a capacity-consuming monitoring process is the only means by which intentions can be retrieved, we argue that the cognitive system relies on multiple processes, including spontaneous processes that reflexively respond to the presence of target events. We present evidence for the existence of spontaneous retrieval processes and apply the idea of multiple processes to mixed findings on age-related decline in prospective memory.},

This unsupervised learning occurs without intent or awareness, but little is known about how it relates to other types of learning, how it affects perceptual processing, and how quickly it can occur. Here we use fMRI during statistical learning to explore these questions. Participants viewed statistically structured versus unstructured sequences of shapes while performing a task unrelated to the structure. Robust neural responses to statistical structure were observed, and these responses were notable in four ways: First, responses to structure were observed in the striatum and medial temporal lobe, suggesting that statistical learning may be related to other forms of associative learning and relational memory. Second, statistical regularities yielded greater activation in category-specific visual regions (object-selective lateral occipital cortex and word-selective ventral occipito-temporal cortex), demonstrating that these regions are sensitive to information distributed in time. Third, evidence of learning emerged early during familiarization, showing that statistical learning can operate very quickly and with little exposure. Finally, neural signatures of learning were dissociable from subsequent explicit familiarity, suggesting that learning can occur in the absence of awareness. Overall, our findings help elucidate the underlying nature of statistical learning.},

  abstract = {Recent neuropsychological and imaging data have implicated different brain networks in the processing of different word classes, nouns being linked primarily to posterior, visual object-processing regions and verbs to frontal, motor-processing areas. However, as most of these studies have examined words in isolation, the consequences of such anatomically based representational differences, if any, for the processing of these items in sentences remains unclear. Additionally, in some languages many words (e.g. `drink') are class-ambiguous, i.e. they can play either role depending on context, and it is not yet known how the brain stores and uses information associated with such lexical items in context. We examined these issues by recording event-related potentials (ERPs) in response to unambiguous nouns (e.g. `beer'), unambiguous verbs (e.g. `eat'), class-ambiguous words and pseudowords used as nouns or verbs within two types of minimally contrastive sentence contexts: noun-predicting (e.g. `John wanted THE [target] but \ldots ') and verb-predicting (`John wanted TO [target] but \ldots '). Our results indicate that the nature of neural processing for nouns and verbs is a function of both the type of stimulus and the role it is playing. Even when the context completely specifies their role, word class-ambiguous items differ from unambiguous ones over frontal regions by \textasciitilde 150 ms. Moreover, whereas pseudowords elicit larger N400s when used as verbs than when used as nouns, unambiguous nouns and ambiguous words used as nouns elicit more frontocentral negativity than unambiguous verbs and ambiguous words used as verbs, respectively. Additionally, unambiguous verbs elicit a left-lateralized, anterior positivity (\textasciitilde 200 ms) not observed for any other stimulus type, though only when these items are used appropriately as verbs (i.e. in verb-predicting contexts). In summary, the pattern of neural activity observed in response to lexical items depends on their general probability of being a verb or a noun and on the particular role they are playing in any given sentence. This implicates more than a simple two-way distinction of the brain networks involved in their storage and processing. Experience, as well as context during on-line language processing, clearly shapes the neural representations of nouns and verbs, such that there is no single neural marker of word class. Our results further suggest that the presence and nature of the word class-based dissociations observed after brain damage are similarly likely to be a function of both the type of stimulus and the context in which it occurs, and thus must be assessed accordingly.},

Words such as undercut and bakery appear to be composed of units, traditionally called morphemes, that recombine in rule-like ways to form other words, such as underline and cannery. However, morphological systems are quasiregular: they are systematic and productive but admit many seemingly irregular forms. Thus, bakery is related to bake and cannery to can but what is the groce in grocery? There is no bread in sweetbreads, liver in deliver, corn in corner or ginger in gingerly. Such words exhibit partial regularities concerning the correspondences between form and meaning, the treatment of which has important implications for linguistic and psycholinguistic theories.

The same challenge reappears in natural language processing in the context of handling words that were not seen in the training set (out-of-vocabulary, or OOV, words). Prior research showed that a good indicator of the productivity of a morpheme is the number of words involving it that occur exactly once (the hapax legomena). A technical connection was adduced between this result and Good-Turing smoothing, which assigns probability mass to unseen events on the basis of the simplifying assumption that word frequencies are stationary. In a large-scale study of 133 affixes in Wikipedia, we develop evidence that success in fact depends on tapping the frequency range in which the assumptions of Good-Turing are violated.},

In under 2 decades sequential cohorts of learners systematized the grammar of this new sign language. The authors examined whether the systematicity being added to the language stems from children or adults; results indicate that such changes originate in children aged 10 and younger.

  abstract = {Notes that people comprehend utterances rapidly and without conscious effort. Traditional theories assume that sentence processing is algorithmic and that meaning is derived compositionally. The language processor is believed to generate representations of the linguistic input that are complete, detailed, and accurate. However, findings challenge these assumptions. Investigations of the misinterpretation of both garden-path and passive sentences have yielded support for the idea that the meaning people obtain for a sentence is often not a reflection of its true content. Moreover, incorrect interpretations may persist even after syntactic reanalysis has taken place. The authors suggest a "good enough" approach to language comprehension which holds that language processing is sometimes only partial and that semantic representations are often incomplete. Future work will elucidate the conditions under which sentence processing is simply good enough. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {The present paper explores the representation of inflectional morphology in the English lexicon. There has been a long-standing debate about how these inflectional relationships might be involved during on-line processing. Inflected forms may be derived from an uninflected base form by rule application; by contrast, both regular and irregular inflection may be treated in the same way, with morphological patterns emerging from mappings between base and inflected forms. The present series of experiments investigated these issues using a lexical decision task. The first experiment showed that response latencies to nouns were significantly shorter than those to verbs. A possible explanation for these results can be found in differences in inflectional structure between English nouns and verbs. Namely, the relative frequency of uninflected compared with inflected forms is greater for nouns than for verbs. Two additional experiments compared noun stimuli with different inflectional structures. In all cases, differences in response latencies were predicted by the frequency of the surface form, whether uninflected or inflected. The pattern of results lends support for a unitary associative system for processing regular inflection of nouns in English and argues against the view that regular inflected plurals are derived by rule from a single, uninflected lexical entry.},

Recently, however, evidence has emerged that by 8 months, infants can extract statistical patterns in auditory input that are based on transitional probabilities defining the sequencing of the input's components (Science 274 (1996) 1926). This finding suggests powerful learning mechanisms that are functional in infancy, and raises questions about the domain generality of such mechanisms. We habituated 2-, 5-, and 8-month-old infants to sequences of discrete visual stimuli whose ordering followed a statistically predictable pattern. The infants subsequently viewed the familiar pattern alternating with a novel sequence of identical stimulus components, and exhibited significantly greater interest in the novel sequence at all ages. These results provide support for the likelihood of domain general statistical learning in infancy, and imply that mechanisms designed to detect structure inherent in the environment may play an important role in cognitive development.},

The normally reading children performed better than dyslexic children on both memory tasks and a test of morphology. Base words were better recalled than morphologically complex words.

Consistent with accounts of the hemispheric asymmetries characterizing withdrawal-related negative affect and visuospatial working memory (WM) in prefrontal and parietal cortices, threat-induced anxiety selectively disrupted accuracy of spatial but not verbal WM performance. Furthermore, individual differences in physiological measures of anxiety statistically mediated the degree of disruption. A second experiment revealed that individuals characterized by high levels of behavioral inhibition exhibited more intense anxiety and relatively worse spatial WM performance in the absence of threat, solidifying the authors' inference that anxiety causally mediates disruption. These observations suggest a revision of extant models of how anxiety sculpts cognition and underscore the utility of the desiderata.

To test this alternative, series of 3 words were visually presented to subjects in a relatively rapid succession in order to prevent any disengagement of attention. In one block, participants had to judge whether the meaning of the 1st word was related to that of the 3rd. Representations activated by the 2nd word were thus inappropriate and had to be ignored. In another block, these representations were task appropriate as subjects were asked to decide whether the meaning of the 2nd word was related to that of the 3rd. The new technique of massive repetitions was used in order to obtain early peaking and short lasting N400 effects that would be easier to distinguish from effects on the contingent negative variations (CNVs) triggered by the expectancy of 3rd words. The ERPs elicited by 2nd words were more negative in the N400 time window when their meanings were task inappropriate than when these meanings had to be used. These differences were maximal at the latency of the peak of the N400 deflection rather than at the latency of the maximum of the late positive complex or at that of the CNV. They appeared to be greater at centro-parietal sites and slightly larger over the right than over the left hemiscalp. The results thus bring further support to the idea that N400 processes are of an inhibitory nature.},

This can be shown by studying behavioral and neurophysiological measures of accelerated word recognition when semantically or phonemically related information is provided in advance, resulting in accompanying attenuation of the respective event-related potential, i.e. the N400 effect. Against the background of age-dependent changes in a broad variety of lexical capacities, we aimed to study whether word priming is accomplished differently in elderly compared to young persons. 19 young (29.9\,{$\pm$}\,5.6~years) and 15 older (69.0\,{$\pm$}\,7.2~years) healthy adults participated in a primed lexical decision task that required the classification of target stimuli (words or pseudo-words) following related or unrelated prime words. We assessed reaction time, task accuracy and N400 responses. Acceleration of word recognition by semantic and phonemic priming was significant in both groups, but resulted in overall larger priming effects in the older participants. Compared with young adults, the older participants were slower and less accurate in responding to unrelated word-pairs. The expected N400 effect was smaller in older than young adults, particularly during phonemic word and pseudo-word priming, with a rather similar N400 amplitude reduction by semantic relatedness. The observed~pattern of~results is consistent with preserved or even enhanced lexical context sensitivity in older compared to young adults. This, however, appears to involve compensatory cognitive strategies with higher lexical processing costs during phonological processing in particular, suggested by a reduced N400 effect in the elderly.},

Finally, the implications of changes in third person singular, sex-indefinite pronouns for several issues of general interest within linguistics are explored.},

Witkin, 1948), the authors predicted that the strength of many visual illusions would increase when observers were tilted 30\textdegree. The magnitude of Z\"ollner, Poggendorff, and Ponzo illusions and the tilt-induction effect substantially increased when observers were tilted. In contrast, the M\"uller-Lyer illusion and a size constancy illusion, which are not related to orientation perception, were not affected by body orientation.

Moreover, the results of single word and sentence comprehension tasks suggest that her ability to access lexical forms of verbs is sensitive to their thematic properties. When contrasted with patients who have specific deficits in processing morphosyntactic properties of verbs [J. Neurolinguist. 15 (2002) 265], HG's pattern of performance can be seen as evidence that grammatical properties are functionally distinct from other aspects of lexical representation.

  abstract = {Any approach to understanding morphological processing must begin with assumptions about the role of morphemes in linguistic representations. Contemporary linguistic theory proposes that such representations are centred on a syntactic organisation of morphemes, where a morpheme is an abstract syntactic unit that finds an interpretation in form and in meaning. From the linguist's perspective, then, morphological processing falls together with syntactic processing, and both involve the central exploitation of a grammar of morphemes. Recent computational work has challenged this perspective, proposing instead that morphological structure emerges from the acquisition of form/meaning connections. Here we show that these challenges to the role of morphemes in word and sentence processing rest on a misunderstanding of the morpheme within linguistic theory. Once we understand the notion of a morpheme and its explanatory role within linguistic theory, we can see that apparent challenges to the morpheme, rather than dispensing with the morpheme in the architecture of linguistic representations, always in fact presuppose a syntactic structure of morphemes as the unlearned input to language learning models. Since computational modelling is indispensable for work connecting theories of linguistic representation to theories of (morphological) processing, it is crucial that those constructing computational models appreciate why there is no escape from morphemes in morphological processing.},

  abstract = {Several recent studies have demonstrated strong relationships between lexical acquisition and subsequent developments within the domain of morphosyntax. A connectionist model of the acquisition of a morphological System analogous to that of the English past tense (Plunkett \& Marchman, 1993) suggests that growth in vocabulary size may relate to the onset of over-regularization errors. However, this model suggests that the relationships between vocabulary size and morphosyntactic development are non-linear. Incremental increases in the number of verbs to be learned result in qualitative shifts in the treatment of both previously learned and novel forms, but only after the size of the lexicon exceeds a particular level (i.e. reaches a `critical mass'). In this paper we present parental report data from an extensive study of English-speaking children aged 1;4 to 2;6 using the MacArthur Communicative Development Inventory: Toddler form (N = 1130). These data corroborate several findings from previous studies, including the early usage of unmarked verb stems and the correct production of irregular past tense forms. Further, we demonstrate support for the `critical mass' view of the onset of over-regularization errors, focusing on continuity among lexical and morphological developments. In our view, these data suggest that these linguistic milestones may be paced by similar, if not identical mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Comments that H. Bird et al (see record 2000-07786-004) have proposed a semantic-conceptual explanation of grammatical category-specific deficits that attributes impairments in noun and verb processing to 2 distinct mechanisms. According to their account, apparent deficits in verb production are not category specific, but rather result from the lower imageability of verbs compared to concrete nouns. Noun deficits are said to result from differences in the distribution of semantic feature types such that damage to sensory features results in disproportionate impairments in naming nouns, especially animate nouns, compared to verbs. However, this hypothesis, which K. Shapiro and A. Caramazza call the "extended sensory/functional theory" (ESFT), fails in several counts. First, the assumption that representations of living things are more heavily freighted with sensory features than are those of nonliving objects does not have any reliable empirical basis. Second, the ESFT incorrectly predicts associations between deficits in processing sensory features and living things or functional features and nonliving things. Finally, there are numerous cases of patients with grammatical category-specific deficits that do not seem to be consistent with damage at the semantic level.

The central topic of the book confronts two views about the morphology of Semitic words. The point of the argument is: Should we see Semitic words morphology as root-based or word-based? The proponents of the root-based approach, present empirical evidence demonstrating that Semitic language speakers are sensitive to the root and the template as the two basic elements (bound morphemes) of Semitic words. Those supporting the word-based approach, present arguments to the effect that Semitic word formation is not based on the merging of roots and templates, but that Semitic words are comprised of word stems and affixes like we find in Indo-European languages. The variety of evidence and arguments for each claim should force the interested readers to reconsider their views on Semitic morphology.},

Exp 2 showed that in an acceptability judgment test of tense-aspect forms, 17 learners of JSL had more difficulty correctly judging the acceptability of the progressive/durative marker (-te i-) with achievement verbs than with activity verbs.

  abstract = {Statistical Learning (SL) is typically considered to be a domain-general mechanism by which cognitive systems discover the underlying statistical regularities in the input. Recent findings, however, show clear differences in processing regularities across modalities and stimuli as well as low correlations between performance on visual and auditory tasks. Why does a presumably domain-general mechanism show distinct patterns of modality and stimulus specificity? Here we claim that the key to this puzzle lies in the prior knowledge brought upon by learners to the learning task. Specifically, we argue that learners' already entrenched expectations about speech co-occurrences from their native language impacts what they learn from novel auditory verbal input. In contrast, learners are free of such entrenchment when processing sequences of visual material such as abstract shapes. We present evidence from three experiments supporting this hypothesis by showing that auditory-verbal tasks display distinct item-specific effects resulting in low correlations between test items. In contrast, non-verbal tasks - visual and auditory - show high correlations between items. Importantly, we also show that individual performance in visual and auditory SL tasks that do not implicate prior knowledge regarding co-occurrence of elements, is highly correlated. In a fourth experiment, we present further support for the entrenchment hypothesis by showing that the variance in performance between different stimuli in auditory-verbal statistical learning tasks can be traced back to their resemblance to participants' native language. We discuss the methodological and theoretical implications of these findings, focusing on models of domain generality/specificity of SL.},

In recent years, however, researchers show increased interest in individual abilities in SL, either to predict other cognitive capacities or as a tool for understanding the mechanism underlying SL. Most, if not all of this research enterprise employs SL tasks that were originally designed for group-level studies. We argue that from an individual difference perspective, such tasks are psychometrically weak and sometimes even flawed. In particular, existing SL tasks have three major shortcomings: (1) the number of trials in the test phase is often too small (or, there is extensive repetitions of the same targets throughout the test), (2) a large proportion of the sample performs at chance level so that most of the data points reflect noise, and (3) test items following familiarization are all of the same type and identical level of difficulty. These factors lead to high measurement error, inevitably resulting in low reliability and thereby doubtful validity. Here we present a novel method specifically designed for the measurement of individual differences in visual SL. The novel task we offer displays substantially superior psychometric properties. We report data regarding the reliability of the task, and discuss the importance of the implementation of such tasks in future research.},

  abstract = {In recent years, statistical learning (SL) research has seen a growing interest in tracking individual performance in SL tasks, mainly as a predictor of linguistic abilities. We review studies from this line of research and outline three presuppositions underlying the experimental approach they employ: (i) that SL is a unified theoretical construct; (ii) that current SL tasks are interchangeable, and equally valid for assessing SL ability; and (iii) that performance in the standard forced-choice test in the task is a good proxy of SL ability. We argue that these three critical presuppositions are subject to a number of theoretical and empirical issues. First, SL shows patterns of modality- and informational-specificity, suggesting that SL cannot be treated as a unified construct. Second, different SL tasks may tap into separate sub-components of SL that are not necessarily interchangeable. Third, the commonly used forced-choice tests in most SL tasks are subject to inherent limitations and confounds. As a first step, we offer a methodological approach that explicitly spells out a potential set of different SL dimensions, allowing for better transparency in choosing a specific SL task as a predictor of a given linguistic outcome. We then offer possible methodological solutions for better tracking and measuring SL ability. Taken together, these discussions provide a novel theoretical and methodological approach for assessing individual differences in SL, with clear testable predictions.

Although these studies convincingly demonstrate change blindness for objects in still images and motion pictures, they may not adequately assess the capacity to represent objects in the real world. Here we examine and reject the possibility that change blindness in previous studies resulted from passive viewing of 2-D displays. In one experiment, an experimenter initiated a conversation with a pedestrian, and during the interaction, he was surreptitiously replaced by a different experimenter. Only half of the pedestrians detected the change. Furthermore, successful detection depended on social group membership; pedestrians from the same social group as the experimenters detected the change but those from a different social group did not. A second experiment further examined the importance of this effect of social group. Provided that the meaning of the scene is unchanged, changes to attended objects can escape detection even when they occur during a natural, real-world interaction. The discussion provides a set of guidelines and suggestions for future research on change blindness.},

Taken together, these findings suggest that we perceive and remember only those objects and details that receive focused attention. In this paper, we briefly review and discuss evidence for these cognitive forms of `blindness'. We then present a new study that builds on classic studies of divided visual attention to examine inattentional blindness for complex objects and events in dynamic scenes. Our results suggest that the likelihood of noticing an unexpected object depends on the similarity of that object to other objects in the display and on how difficult the priming monitoring task is. Interestingly, spatial proximity of the critical unattended object to attended locations does not appear to affect detection, suggesting that observers attend to objects and events, not spatial positions. We discuss the implications of these results for visual representations and awareness of our visual environment.},

  abstract = {Conducted 2 experiments to examine the word recognition processes of 2nd, 4th, and 6th graders. In Exp I, 72 Ss named target words that were primed by words that had more than 1 meaning. Targets were related either to the more or less frequent sense of the ambiguous prime or were unrelated to it. Findings indicate that older Ss were more likely than younger Ss to restrict processing of ambiguous words to the most frequent meaning. While younger Ss showed approximately equal facilitation for words related to either meaning, regardless of each one's relative frequency, 6th graders apparently retrieved only the most frequent meaning. Exp II, with 36 Ss, was similar to Exp I but included neutral primes and varied the interval between presentation of prime and target. Results show that all groups showed automatic retrieval of both meanings of the ambiguous word. For 6th graders, however, this retrieval was followed by a 2nd stage, in which attention was allocated to the more frequent meaning, maintaining it, while the less frequent meaning was inhibited. Overall data indicate that older children use meaning frequency to narrow the amount of information kept active following word recognition. (34 ref)},

  abstract = {Following much work in linguistic theory, it is hypothesized that the language faculty has a modular structure and consists of two basic components, a lexicon of (structured) entries and a computational system of combinatorial operations to form larger linguistic expressions from lexical entries. This target article provides evidence for the dual nature of the language faculty by describing recent results of a multidisciplinary investigation of German inflection. We have examined: (1) its linguistic representation, focussing on noun plurals and verb inflection (participles), (2) processes involved in the way adults produce and comprehend inflected words, (3) brain potentials generated during the processing of inflected words, and (4) the way children acquire and use inflection. It will be shown that the evidence from all these sources converges and supports the distinction between lexical entries and combinatorial operations.Our experimental results indicate that adults have access to two distinct processing routes, one accessing (irregularly) inflected entries from the mental lexicon and another involving morphological decomposition of (regularly) inflected words into stem+affix representations. These two processing routes correspond to the dual structure of the linguistic system. Results from event-related potentials confirm this linguistic distinction at the level of brain structures. In children's language, we have also found these two processes to be clearly dissociated; regular and irregular inflection are used under different circumstances, and the constraints under which children apply them are identical to those of the adult linguistic system.Our findings will be explained in terms of a linguistic model that maintains the distinction between the lexicon and the computational system but replaces the traditional view of the lexicon as a simple list of idiosyncrasies with the notion of internally structured lexical representations.},

In addition, the anomalies in movies evoked a large late positive potential at posterior regions, suggesting that in event perception, semantic incongruity may trigger cognitive processes other than those mediating pure semantic integration.

Three experiments investigated speakers' tendency to produce syntactic structures that allow for early production of material that is accessible in memory. In Experiment 1, speakers produced accessible information early less often when under a verbal WM load than when under no load. Experiment 2 found the same pattern for given-new ordering (i.e., when accessibility was manipulated by making information given). Experiment 3 addressed the possibility that these effects do not reflect WM mechanisms but rather increased task difficulty by relying on the distinction between verbal and spatial WM: Speakers' tendency to produce sentences respecting given-new ordering was reduced more by a verbal than by a spatial WM load. These patterns show that accessibility effects do in fact reflect accessibility in verbal WM and that representations in sentence production are vulnerable to interference from other information in memory.

We present evidence that: (a) similarity can drive categorization early in development; and (b) early in development, humans have powerful learning mechanisms that enable them to extract regularities in the environment. We conclude that, despite remaining challenges, the similarity-based approach offers a promising account of the development of categorization.

As reading does not train all parts of the retina in the same way but favors regions on the side in the direction of scanning, visual word recognition should be better at retinal locations that are frequently used during reading. In two studies that probed word and letter discriminations we provided evidence for a correlation between eye fixation pattern during reading and performance. We showed that effects of reading-related visual training were stimulus-specific in the sense that it affected the perception of words but not that of visually unfamiliar non-words. This stimulus specificity was also evident in the legibility of individual characters of the Roman and the Hebrew scripts\textemdash two scripts that are read in opposing directions. When displayed within a sequence of homogenous letters (e.g., xxexx) the legibility of a target character varied with the location of the sequence in the visual field and with the serial position of the target within the sequence. This retinal location- and context-dependency differed between Roman and Hebrew characters. These results seem to indicate that reading modifies the functional structure of early stages in the visual pathway. The cortical network that supports reading seems to comprise components of the visual cortex of both hemispheres before it lateralizes to the left hemisphere. Expanding the reading network to include these visual regions will shed a different light on the potential role of the visual word form area (e.g., Cohen et al., 2000) in word recognition and on the organization of the reading system in general.},

Also, the role of the primary visual cortex, V1, in color processing now seems much larger than it did in 1985. The re-evaluation of the important role of V1 in color vision was caused in part by investigations of human V1 responses to color, measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI, and in part by the results of numerous studies of single-unit neurophysiology in non-human primates. The neurophysiological results have highlighted the importance of double-opponent cells in V1.

Three classes of affixed words were presented in a lexical decision task: free stems (e.g., taxable), bound roots (e.g., tolerable), and unique root words (e.g., vulnerable, the root of which does not appear elsewhere). Analysis was focused on brain responses within 100-200 msec poststimulus onset in the previously identified letter string and visual word-form areas. MEG data were analyzed using cortically constrained minimum-norm estimation. Correlations were computed between activity at functionally defined ROIs and continuous measures of the words' morphological properties. ROIs were identified across subjects on a reference brain and then morphed back onto each individual subject's brain (n = 9). We find evidence of decomposition for both free stems and bound roots at the M170 stage in processing. The M170 response is shown to be sensitive to morphological properties such as affix frequency and the conditional probability of encountering each word given its stem. These morphological properties are contrasted with orthographic form features (letter string frequency, transition probability from one string to the next), which exert effects on earlier stages in processing (\textasciitilde 130 msec). We find that effects of decomposition at the M170 can, in fact, be attributed to morphological properties of complex words, rather than to purely orthographic and form-related properties. Our data support a model of word recognition in which decomposition is attempted, and possibly utilized, for complex words containing bound roots as well as free word-stems.

  abstract = {Do properties of individual languages shape the mechanisms by which they are processed? By virtue of their non-concatenative morphological structure, the recognition of complex words in Semitic languages has been argued to rely strongly on morphological information and on decomposition into root and pattern constituents. Here, we report results from a masked priming experiment in Hebrew in which we contrasted verb forms belonging to two morphological classes, Paal and Piel, which display similar properties, but crucially differ on whether they are extended to novel verbs. Verbs from the open-class Piel elicited familiar root priming effects, but verbs from the closed-class Paal did not. Our findings indicate that, similarly to other (e.g., Indo-European) languages, down-to-the-root decomposition in Hebrew does not apply to stems of non-productive verbal classes. We conclude that the Semitic word processor is less unique than previously thought: Although it operates on morphological units that are combined in a non-linear way, it engages the same universal mechanisms of storage and computation as those seen in other languages.},

A correlational analysis method was employed to examine effects of the heteronyms' form and lexical properties on brain activity. We find support for the 'late access' view, in that lexical properties did not affect processing until after 300 ms, while earlier activation was primarily modulated by orthographic form.},

  abstract = {Recent work has suggested that variability in levels of neural activation may be related to behavioral and cognitive performance across a number of domains and may offer information that is not captured by more traditional measures that use the average level of brain activation. We examined the relationship between reading skill in school-aged children and neural activation variability during a functional MRI reading task after taking into account average levels of activity. The reading task involved matching printed and spoken words to pictures of items. Single trial activation estimates were used to calculate the mean and standard deviation of children's responses to print and speech stimuli; multiple regression analyses evaluated the relationship between reading skill and trial-by-trial activation variability. The reliability of observed findings from the discovery sample (n = 44; ages 8\textendash 11; 18 female) was then confirmed in an independent sample of children (n = 32; ages 8\textendash 11; 14 female). Across the two samples, reading skill was positively related to trial-by-trial variability in the activation response to print in the left inferior frontal gyrus pars triangularis. This relationship held even when accounting for mean levels of activation. This finding suggests that intrasubject variability in trial-by-trial fMRI activation responses to printed words accounts for individual differences in human reading ability that are not fully captured by traditional mean levels of brain activity. Furthermore, this positive relationship between trial-by-trial activation variability and reading skill may provide evidence that neural variability plays a beneficial role during early reading development. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Recent work has suggested that neural activation variability, or moment-to-moment changes in the engagement of brain regions, is related to individual differences in behavioral and cognitive performance across multiple domains. However, differences in neural activation variability have not yet been evaluated in relation to reading skill. In the current study, we analyzed data from two independent groups of children who performed an fMRI task involving reading and listening to words. Across both samples, reading skill was positively related to trial-by-trial variability in activation to print stimuli in the left inferior frontal gyrus pars triangularis, even when accounting for the more conventional measure of mean levels of brain activity. This finding suggests that neural variability could be beneficial in developing readers.},

Whereas the -s plurals yielded no wordform frequency effects, such effects could be observed for all other plural forms, including all subclasses of -n plurals. The priming experiment (conducted with 29 male and 34 female Ss, mean age 26 yrs) produced a different pattern. The authors found that the prior presentations of fully predictable -n plurals prime the stems as effectively as the stem itself, whereas -n plurals with limited predictability yielded only reduced priming effects toward their stems.

Consequently, it is not clear whether morphology is a basic element of a linguistic structure or whether it emerges from systematic regularities between the form and meaning of words. Here, we looked for evidence of morphological structure at a neural systems level by using a visual masked priming paradigm and functional MRI. Form and meaning relations were manipulated in a 2 x 2 design to identify reductions in blood oxygenation level-dependent signal related to shared form (e.g., corner-corn), shared meaning (e.g., idea-notion), and shared morphemes (e.g., boldly-bold, which overlapped in both form and meaning). Relative to unrelated pairs (e.g., ozone-hero), morphologically related items reduced blood oxygenation level-dependent signal in the posterior angular gyrus bilaterally, left occipitotemporal cortex, and left middle temporal gyrus. In the posterior angular gyrus, a neural priming effect was observed for all three priming conditions, possibly reflecting reduced attentional demands rather than overlapping linguistic representations per se. In contrast, the reductions seen in the left occipitotemporal cortex and left middle temporal gyrus corresponded, respectively, to main effects of orthographic and semantic overlap. As neural regions sensitive to morphological structure overlapped almost entirely with regions sensitive to orthographic and semantic relatedness, our results suggest that morphology emerges from the convergence of form and meaning.},

The main issues identified are the cost of the current available ELNs, their ease of use (or lack of it) and their accessibility issues across different devices and operating systems. Evidence suggests that whilst scientists willingly make use of generic notebooking software, spreadsheets and other general office and scientific tools to aid their work, current ELNs are lacking in the required functionality to meet the needs of the researchers.

  abstract = {Phonological processing skills have been shown to account for some, but not all, of the variance in the word recognition ability of both children and adults. In two studies with adult subjects in the United States, the authors investigated whether orthographic processing ability--the ability to form, store, and access orthographic representations--can account for some of the additional variance in word recognition and spelling skill. A new measure of individual differences in exposure to print--the Author Recognition Test--was developed and validated in the two studies. This measure was designed to be relatively free of a confound that has plagued most print exposure indicators used in studies of adults: the tendency of respondents to give socially desirable answers. The Author Recognition Test was shown to be a remarkably robust and independent predictor of word processing ability. In Study 2, subjects' performance on this measure was shown to predict variance in orthographic processing independent of phonological factors. The results of the two studies were supportive of the idea that there are individual differences in reading and spelling caused by variation in orthographic processing skills. Moreover, these orthographic processing skills appear to be linked to print exposure, and thus to be environmentally mediated, rather than being simply indirect products of differences in phonological processing ability. Both studies demonstrate the potential usefulness of the Author Recognition Test as an indicator of print exposure in research on the cognitive consequences of literacy. /// [French] Les recherches ant\'erieures ont montr\'e que certaines habilet\'es de traitement phonologique comptent pour une partie de la variance dans la reconnaissance de mots aussi bien par les adultes que par les enfants.

Le test de reconnaissance d'auteurs s'est r\'ev\'el\'e un pr\'edicteur extr\^emement robuste et ind\'ependant de l'habilet\'e \`a traiter des mots. Dans la seconde exp\'erience, les r\'esultats des sujets \`a cette mesure ont permis de pr\'edire une partie importante de la variance pour le traitement orthographique ind\'ependamment des facteurs phonologiques. Les r\'esultats aux deux exp\'eriences appuient l'id\'ee qu'une partie des diff\'erences individuelles en lecture et en \'epellation est due aux habilet\'es de traitement orthographique. De plus, ces habilet\'es de traitement orthographique apparaissent li\'ees au degr\'e d'exposition \`a l'\'ecrit ce qui permet de poser comme hypoth\`ese que l'acquisition de ces habilet\'es est conditionn\'ee par l'environnement et n'est pas uniquement le produit des diff\'erences individuelles dans les habilet\'es de traitement phonologique.

En dos experimentos con sujetos adultos en los Estados Unidos, los autores investigaron si la habilidad de procesamiento ortogr\'afico puede explicar la varianza adicional en el reconocimiento de palabras y su habilidad ortogr\'afica. Una nueva medida de diferencias individuales en la exposici\'on a materiales impresos--La prueba de reconocimiento de autores (ART)--fue desarrollada y validada en dos experimentos. Esta medida fue dise\~nada para estar relativamente libre de un problema que han sufrido la mayor\'ia de los indicadores de exposici\'on a materiales impresos que se usan en estudios de adultos--la tendencia de los sujetos a dar respuestas que ellos piensan son las que se esperan de ellos; las socialmente deseables. La prueba de reconocimiento de autores demostr\'o ser un predictor notablemente robusto e independiente para predecir la habilidad de procesar palabras. En el Experimento 2, el desempe\~no de los sujetos en esta medida demostr\'o que pod\'ia predecir la variabilidad en el procesamiento ortogr\'afico, de manera independiente de los factores fonol\'ogicos. Los resultados de dos experimentos apoyan la idea de que hay diferencias individuales en lectura y ortograf\'ia causadas por la variaci\'on en las habilidades del procesamiento ortogr\'afico. Adem\'as, estas habilidades de procesamiento ortogr\'afico parecen estar relacionadas con la exposici\'on a materiales impresos, y de esta manera estar mediados ambientalmente m\'as bien, que ser simplemente productos indirectos de diferencias en la habilidad del procesamiento fonol\'ogico.

It expands on the cognitive linguistic approach to metaphor in language and thought by adding the dimension of communication, and it expands on the predominantly linguistic and psychological approaches by adding the discipline of social science. This creates a map of the field in which nine main areas of research can be distinguished and connected to each other in precise ways. It allows for renewed attention to the deliberate use of metaphor in communication, in contrast with non-deliberate use, and asks the question whether the interaction between deliberate and non-deliberate use of metaphor in specific social domains can contribute to an explanation of the discourse career of metaphor. The suggestion is made that metaphorical models in language, thought, and communication can be classified as official, contested, implicit, and emerging, which may offer new perspectives on the interaction between social, psychological, and linguistic properties and functions of metaphor in discourse.}

Deliberate and conscious metaphorical thought is connected to the general functions of all conscious thought as described by Baumeister and Masicampo (2010). Their theory provides a basis for demonstrating how deliberate and conscious metaphorical cognition facilitate social and cultural interactions, by reconsidering Musolff's (2004) analysis of metaphor in political discourse on European integration. The paper concludes by formulating some implications of CMT's neglect of conscious metaphor and of deliberate metaphor more generally. If the power of metaphor lies in thought, as has been held by CMT for thirty years, it may be that conscious rather than unconscious cognition - or, more generally, deliberate rather than non-deliberate metaphor use - enables that power. Given the relative infrequency of deliberate and conscious metaphor use, this, in turn, may entail that the online effect of metaphor is more restricted than has been assumed over the past three decades.},

It is likely that most deliberate metaphor is processed metaphorically (by comparison), as opposed to most nondeliberate metaphor, which may be assumed to be typically not processed metaphorically (that is, by categorization). This resolves the paradox of metaphor because it suggests that all ``metaphor in communication'' (all deliberate metaphor) is processed metaphorically.

It appears that all novel metaphors and some conventional metaphors are used deli-berately, and that this happens when they are intended to produce a change in the perspective of the addressee on the topic of a stretch of discourse. This typically happens for all metaphors that are expressed directly, such as extended non-literal comparisons and similes. Indirect metaphors can also be used deliberately, but this does not occur very frequently.

The second section presents early ERP studies supporting the CPH, discusses some of their methodological problems, and follows up with data from more recent studies avoiding these problems. It is concluded that well-controlled ERP studies support the convergence hypothesis, according to which L2 learners initially differ from native speakers and then converge on native-like neurocognitive processing mechanisms. The fact that ERPs in late L2 learners at high levels of proficiency are often indistinguishable from those of native speakers suggests that age-of-acquisition effects in SLA are not primarily driven by maturational constraints.},

Errors involve vowel-changing irregular forms more than suffixing inflected forms, with at best a small difference between regular -ed and irregular -en.

  abstract = {Early morphological decomposition of complex words has been supported by evidence showing that the magnitude of masked transposed-letter (TL) priming effects is greater for within-morpheme transpositions than for between-morpheme transpositions. However, these findings have lately been called into question, and a recent article by S\'anchez-Guti\'errez and Rastle (Psychonomic Bulletin \& Review, 20, 988\textendash 996, 2013) suggested that the above-mentioned interaction could have been the consequence of a false positive (i.e., a Type I error). Considering recent evidence showing that morpho-orthographic interactions are highly sensitive to individual differences in reading skills, we explored whether participants' averaged reading speeds were responsible for modulating the size of within- versus between-morpheme TL priming effects. A large-scale lexical decision experiment with a set of 420 suffixed Spanish words (N = 80 participants) was run using the masked-priming technique. The results revealed that individual differences modulated the magnitude of the masked TL priming effect between morphemes: Faster readers (but not slower readers) yielded greater TL priming for within- than for between-morpheme transpositions. The present data help reconcile previous divergent data by showing that faster readers revealed a morpho-orthographic interaction, whereas slower readers may rely more on a morphological-processing strategy that is not sensitive to morpho-orthographic interactions.},

However, the subject matter of psychophysiology \textemdash{} the interaction of mind and body \textemdash{} has been studied for centuries by people trained as philosophers, physicists, physicians, physiologists, and, most recently, psychologists. John Stern (1964) defined the work of psychophysiology as ``any research in which the dependent variable (the subject's response) is a physiological measure and the independent variable (the factor manipulated by the experimenter) a behavioral one''. Stern's definition of psychophysiology is not incorrect, but with the passage of time it has become too limiting. The type of research he was defining examined the physiological changes that accompanied certain psychological or behavioral manipulations. More recent experiments conducted by psychophysiologists show that it is equally tenable to manipulate physiological variables and examine behavioral changes. This chapter discusses the history of psychophysiology, Luigi Galvani's research on the electrical properties of the skin, theory on how electricity could improve people's health, and early instruments used to record psychophysiological changes.},

Results showed that, while high frequency words produced less negative amplitudes in the N400 time window than low frequency words, the inverse pattern was found for syllable frequency. Words containing high frequency syllables produced more negative amplitudes than words containing low frequency syllables. Importantly, a significant syllable frequency effect was also obtained at the P200 time window. The results are interpreted in the framework of an interactive activation model, in which high frequency syllables produce the initial activation of a larger number of lexical candidates during the analysis of orthographic or phonological representations, which have to be inhibited later to allow the identification of a unique word. These findings support the idea that, at least in languages with clear syllabic boundaries, syllables are functional sublexical units during visual word recognition.

It is argued that the AFM has the virtues of being applicable to a variety of problems, and requiring relatively few theoretical assumptions. It is noted that the method is limited to discovering modules that are arranged in series, as a sequence of stages.

Recent work using MEG to uncover the dynamic temporal and spatial responses evoked by visually presented complex suffixed single words provide us with a comprehensive picture of morphological processing in the brain, from early, form-based decomposition, through lexical access, grammatically constrained recomposition, and semantic interpretation. In the present study, we find that MEG responses to prefixed words reveal interesting early differences in the lateralization of the form-based decomposition response compared to the effects reported in the literature for suffixed words, but a very similar post-decomposition profile. These results not only address a question stretching back to the earliest days of modern psycholinguistics, but also add critical support and nuance to our much newer emerging understanding of spatial organization and temporal dynamics of morphological processing in the human brain.},

Evidence for the model is provided in two MEG priming experiments that measure root activation prior to lexical decision.

It appears that this processing is sensitive to the contribution that these characters make to the meaning of the compound word in which they occur, in that there are differences observed between transparent and opaque compounds. The multilevel interactive/activation framework was presented for thinking about this analytic processing whereby morphemic units are explicitly represented. On considering some conceptual problems with this framework, however, a modification was suggested in which there are no explicit morphemic units, but rather a set of abstract units linking orthographically based character units with semantic units (and phonologically based syllable units). These lemma units simply emerge from the co-occurrence of orthographic forms with meaning. The evidence for this conceptualization of the recognition system for compound words is still quite scanty and clearly more is needed to confirm the ideas proposed in this chapter.

This has been put forward as an argument that language is a module which is biologically programmed and develops independently of other cognitive abilities. However there have been very few studies which have directly compared the two populations. In this article we compare individuals with WS with individuals with SLI on a number of verbal and non-verbal standardised tests as well as on their language abilities in a narrative task. The participants with WS performed similarly to the participants with SLI on the verbal standardised tests and in the narrative task (there were no significant differences between the two groups of participants) although they performed significantly lower on the non-verbal standardised tests in comparison to the participants with SLI. The results suggest that although there are dissociations between WS and SLI in the non-verbal domain, the two populations are very similar in the domain of morpho-syntax, hence there is no support for developmental double dissociations between these two populations.},

In this paradigm, a prime is presented prior to the definition of a target word, and the task is to produce the target word. The authors view the process of word retrieval as requiring access from a conceptually organized semantic network to an orthographically and phonemically organized lexical network. Primes that were orthographically (and phonemically) related to the target words facilitated word retrieval. Both semantically related and unrelated primes inhibited word retrieval. Inhibition from both of these sources is attributed in part to the orthographic unrelatedness of these primes. This explanation is consistent with data from several other word retrieval studies (e.g., A. S. Brown [see PA, Vol 64:4730]). The word retrieval task is contrasted with the lexical decision task. It is suggested that the differential effects of orthographic and semantic priming in word retrieval and lexical decision are due to differences in retrieval processing between the 2 tasks.

Error-related events attract more attention, as evidenced by features of event-related scalp potentials previously implicated in selective visual attention (selection negativity, augmented anterior N1).

Furthermore, activation of the left thalamus appeared to be specifically involved in deriving meaning from metaphoric sentences despite lack of reaction times differences between literals and metaphors. We assign this to the ad hoc concept construction and open-endedness of metaphoric interpretation.

  abstract = {Recent ERP findings challenge the widespread assumption that syntactic and semantic processes are tightly coupled. Syntactically well-formed sentences that are semantically anomalous due to thematic mismatches elicit a P600, the component standardly associated with syntactic anomaly. This `thematic P600' effect has been attributed to detection of semantically plausible thematic relations that conflict with the surface syntactic structure of the sentence, implying a processing architecture with an independent semantic analyzer. A key finding is that the P600 is selectively sensitive to the presence of plausible verb-argument relations, and that otherwise an N400 is elicited (The hearty meal was devouring \ldots{} vs. The dusty tabletop was devouring \ldots : Kim \& Osterhout, 2005). The current study investigates in Spanish whether the evidence for an independent semantic analyzer is better explained by a standard architecture that rapidly integrates multiple sources of lexical, syntactic, and semantic information. The study manipulated the presence of plausible thematic relations, and varied the choice of auxiliary between passive-biased fue and active-progressive biased estaba. Results show a late positivity that appeared as soon as comprehenders detected an improbable combination of subject animacy, auxiliary bias, or verb voice morphology. This effect appeared at the lexical verb in the fue conditions and at the auxiliary in the estaba conditions. The late positivity elicited by surface thematic anomalies was the same, regardless of the presence of a plausible non-surface interpretation, and no N400 effects were elicited.

  abstract = {In recent years, attention has been drawn to the possibility that morphology might be of two radically different types; these two types have been labelled \textemdash{} infelicitously, in my view \textemdash{} as layered morphology and template morphology. Intuitively, a morphological expression exhibits template morphology if the ordering of its affixes follows not from the properties of the individual affixes themselves (or of the rules introducing them) but from an independent stipulation about the ordering of these affixes (or rules). By contrast, a morphological expression exhibits layered morphology if the ordering of its affixes is simply an effect of the properties of the individual affixes themselves (or of the rules introducing them). Here, I shall address two fundamental questions about the distinction between template and layered morphology, namely (1) and (2): (1) How does the distinction between template and layered morphology relate to the distinction between inflectional and derivational morphology? (2) What form should templates take in an adequate theory of morphology?},

Disyllabic words and pseudowords were employed manipulating the positional frequency of the 1st and 2nd syllable as well as the word frequency (only for words). A standard lexical decision task (Exp 1) and a temporal separation technique (Exps 2 \& 3), in which either the 1st or 2nd syllable acted as a prime of the whole stimulus, were used, measuring reaction times and errors. The results replicate the inhibitory effect of syllable\textendash frequency obtained in several previous experiments in Spanish and offer support for an activational model incorporating a syllabic level. However, the authors argue that this type of model must incorporate sequential properties: both syllables activate lexical representations but they do not play exactly the same role, indicating a bias toward the 1st syllable. The implications of the findings for the notion of a sequential-type processing are discussed.},

This study investigates the longitudinal association between both theory of mind and psychotic symptoms and social functioning outcome in first-episode psychosis. Methods: Fifty-four people with first-episode psychosis were followed up at 6 and 12 months. Random effects regression models were used to estimate the stability of theory of mind over time and the association between baseline theory of mind and psychotic symptoms and social functioning outcome. Results: Neither baseline theory of mind ability (regression coefficients: Hinting test 1.07 95\% CI -0.74, 2.88; Visual Cartoon test -2.91 95\% CI -7.32, 1.51) nor baseline symptoms (regression coefficients: positive symptoms -0.04 95\% CI -1.24, 1.16; selected negative symptoms -0.15 95\% CI -2.63, 2.32) were associated with social functioning outcome. There was evidence that theory of mind ability was stable over time, (regression coefficients: Hinting test 5.92 95\% CI -6.66, 8.92; Visual Cartoon test score 0.13 95\% CI -0.17, 0.44). Conclusions: Neither baseline theory of mind ability nor psychotic symptoms are associated with social functioning outcome. Further longitudinal work is needed to understand the origin of social functioning deficits in psychosis. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

To this aim we measured event-related brain potentials (ERPs) during a simple lexical decision task in Italian. Two factors were manipulated: Stress dominance (the most frequent stress type) and stress neighborhood consistency (the proportion and number of existent words sharing orthographic ending and stress pattern). Participants were presented with target words either bearing dominant (on the penultimate syllable; 'graNIta,' 'seNIle,' slush, senile) or non-dominant stress (on the antepenultimate syllable; 'MISsile,' 'BIbita,' missile, drink), and either having a consistent (graNIta, MISsile) or an inconsistent stress neighborhood (seNIle, BIbita). Our results showed in the initial stages of processing an effect that we interpreted as an early orthographic marker of stress neighborhood in interaction with dominance. Later, from 250 ms after target onset, a marker of the lexical stress difference also emerged. The role of stress assignment in word recognition is discussed.},

Efficient coding leads to `robust' decisions that depart from optimality but maximise the information transmitted by a limited-capacity system in a rapidly-changing world. We review recent work showing that when perceptual environments are variable or volatile, perceptual decisions exhibit the same suboptimal context-dependence as economic choices, and we propose a general computational framework that accounts for findings across the two domains.

This suggested that the pseudohomophone effect was not a phonological effect. Instead, a conversion of the graphemes of a stimulus item into different graphemes via a set of grapheme-grapheme conversion rules was supported. When phonological factors were tightly controlled and orthographic similarity varied, evidence for the existence of grapheme-grapheme rules was provided in both a lexical-decision task and a task in which Ss were required to say whether an item was pronounced in the same way as a word. Even in the latter task, in which the likelihood of phonological recoding was optimized, it appeared that grapheme-grapheme rules were rarely, if ever, used.

Priming effects were also found for words having homographic-homophonic characters, but the effect tended to be inhibitory when the stimulus onset asynchrony between primes and targets was long and when the competing morphemes corresponding to the characters were at the initial constituent position of primes and targets. Priming effects between words having homographic but non-homophonic characters were more inhibitory, compared with effects between words having homographic-homophonic characters. Words having orthographically different homophonic morphemes did not prime each other throughout the experiments.

Here, we identify the mechanisms underpinning this deficit using event-related brain potentials (ERPs) in dyslexic and control adult readers performing a letter-matching task. In each trial, a printed letter was presented synchronously with an auditory letter name. Incongruent (mismatched), frequent trials were interleaved with congruent (matched) infrequent target pairs, which participants were asked to report by pressing a button. In critical trials, incongruent letter pairs were mismatched but confusable in terms of their visual or phonological features. Typical readers showed early detection of deviant trials, indicated by larger modulation in the range of the phonological mismatch negativity (PMN) compared with standard trials. This was followed by stronger modulation of the P3b wave for visually confusable deviants and an increased lateralized readiness potential (LRP) for phonological deviants, compared with standards. In contrast, dyslexic readers showed reduced sensitivity to deviancy in the PMN range. Responses to deviants in the P3b range indicated normal letter recognition processes, but the LRP calculation revealed a specific impairment for visual-orthographic information during response selection in dyslexia. In a follow-up experiment using an analogous nonlexical task in the same participants, we found no reading-group differences, indicating a degree of specificity to over-learnt visual-phonological binding. Our findings indicate early insensitivity to visual-phonological binding in developmental dyslexia, coupled with difficulty selecting the correct orthographic code.

Ss decided whether or not each target word belonged to the category "words with definable meanings" (e.g., PLANK, PINT) or the category "given names" (e.g., TRENT, PAM). To test phonological mediation, latencies to respond to regular definable words (e.g., PLANK) and irregular definable words (e.g., PINT) were compared. No regularity effect was observed, despite these same words showing a difference in a naming task. Thus the semantic task was shown to be insensitive to a phonological effect. The possibility that the long response times of the semantic categorization task washed out any regularity effect was dismissed on the grounds that both a word frequency effect and a letter transposition effect (e.g., CLUE vs CALM, cf. CLAM) were observed using this task. It is concluded that phonological mediation is not a prerequisite for semantic access. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2002 APA, all rights reserved).},

In addition, an ``outer'' embedding (e.g., jomb vs vomb, cf. job) generates interference that is no greater than for an initial embedding. These results are inconsistent with the idea of left-to-right parsing, while accounts of word recognition that center on open bigrams or the spatial coding of letters require additional processes. Instead, the results are interpreted within a model of word parsing and lexical access that incorporates subsyllabic structures; an account that is supported in Experiments 2 and 3 by the critical finding that an initially embedded word interferes more when it ends in a consonant (e.g., the fur of furb, the shadow of shadowl) than with a vowel (e.g., the tea of teaf, the coffee of coffeep).},

It was found that compound nonwords whose 1st constituent is a word (e.g., DUSTWORTH, FOOTMILGE) took longer to classify as nonwords than compound nonwords whose 1st constituent is not a word (e.g., TROWBREAK, MOWDFLISK). Moreover, the presence of a word in the 2nd constituent position appeared to be irrelevant. These effects were seen even when the boundary between constituents is unclear on an orthographic basis (e.g., TRUCERIN). It is also argued that 1st syllables, as opposed to last syllables, have independent status in the lexicon since nonword 1st syllables (e.g., ATH) show interference effects, while last syllables (e.g., CULE) do not. The 5th experiment revealed that the frequency of the 1st constituent of a compound word influenced classification times. It is concluded that polysyllabic words, regardless of whether they are polymorphemic or monomorphemic, are accessed via their 1st syllable.

Furthermore, the opposite dissociation in the verbal output modality, an advantage for nouns over verbs in spoken tasks, by a different patient using the same stimuli has also been reported (Caramazza \& Hillis, 1991). This double dissociation across patients on the same task indicates that results cannot be ascribed to "greater difficulty" with one type of stimulus, and provides further evidence for the view that grammatical category information is an important organizational principle of lexical knowledge in the brain.},

In this article, we review the literature on human speech perception development within the context of this CP model, highlighting research that reveals the interplay of maturational and experiential influences at key junctures in development and presenting paradigmatic examples testing CP models in human subjects.

  abstract = {Background Children with language disorder across languages have problems with verb morphology. The nature of these problems varies according to the typology of the language. The language analyzed in this paper is the Standard Bangla spoken in Dhaka, Bangladesh, by more than 200 million people. It is an underexplored language with agglutinative features in its verb inflections. Some information on the acquisition of the language by typically developing children is available, but to date we have no information on the nature of ALD. As in many places in the developing world, the circumstances for research into language disorder are challenging, as there is no well-ordered infrastructure for the identification of these children and approaches to intervention are not evidence based. This study represents the first attempt to characterize the nature of morphosyntactic limitations in standard Bangla-speaking children with language disorder. Aims To describe the performance of a group of children with language disorder on elicitation procedures for three Bangla verb inflections of increasing structural complexity\textemdash present simple, present progressive and past progressive\textemdash and to compare their abilities on these forms with those of a group of typically developing Bangla-speaking children. Methods \& Procedures Nine children with language disorder (mean age = 88.11 months) were recruited from a special school in Dhaka. Eight of the children also had a differentiating or co-occurring condition. They responded to three tasks: a semi-structured conversation to elicit present simple, and two picture-based tasks to elicit present progressive and past progressive. Their performance was compared with data available from a large group of younger typically developing children. Outcomes and Results Group data indicated a comparable trajectory of performance by the children with language disorder with the typically developing children (present simple {$>$} present progressive {$>$} past progressive), but with significantly lower mean scores. Standard deviations suggested considerable individual variation and individual profiles were constructed for each child, revealing varying patterns of ability, some of which did not accord with the typical developmental trajectory and/or substitution patterns. Conclusions \& Implications This study identified verb morphology deficits in Bangla-speaking children with language disorder who had asociated conditions. Variation in performance among the children suggests that individual profiles will be most effective in guiding intervention.},

  abstract = {If recognition of a polymorphemic word always takes place via its decomposition into stem and affix, then the higher the frequency of its stem (i.e., base frequency) the easier the lexical decision response should be when frequency of the word itself (i.e., surface frequency) is controlled. Past experiments have demonstrated such a base frequency effect, but not under all circumstances. Thus, a dual pathway notion has become dominant as an account of morphological processing whereby both decomposition and whole-word access is possible. Two experiments are reported here that demonstrate how an obligatory decomposition account can handle the absence of base frequency effects. In particular, it is shown that the later stage of recombining the stem and affix is harder for high base frequency words than for lower base frequency words when matched on surface frequency, and that this can counterbalance the advantage of easier access to the higher frequency stem. When the combination stage is crucial for discriminating the word items from the nonword items, a reverse base frequency effect emerges, revealing the disadvantage at this stage for high base frequency words. Such an effect is hard for the dual-pathway account to explain, but follows naturally from the idea of obligatory ... (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

In order do determine the time course and neural processes involved in online word segmentation and statistical learning of visual sequence, we recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) while participants were exposed to continuous sequences with elements organized into shape-words randomly connected to each other. After viewing three 6.6min sessions of sequences, the participants performed a behavioral choice test. The participants were divided into two groups (high and low learners) based on their behavioral performance. The overall mean performance was 72.2\%, indicating that the shape sequence was segmented and that the participants learned the shape-triplets statistically. Grand-averaged ERPs showed that triplet-onset (the initial shapes of shape-words) elicited larger N400 amplitudes than did middle and final shapes embedded in continuous streams during the early learning sessions of high learners, but no triplet-onset effect was found among low learners. The results suggested that the N400 effect indicated online segmentation of the visual sequence and the degree of statistical learning. Our results also imply that statistical learning represents a common learning device.},

Method Existing evidence was collected via a computerized database search, and the data were summarized in a narrative review. Conclusions Strong, precise lexical representations are key to skilled reading and writing performance, and the available evidence suggests that, in order to become efficient readers, English-speaking children must acquire a rapid and flexible word recognition system that can accommodate the quasiregular morpho-orthographic to semantic mappings that characterize English. Individual differences may affect how easily children are able to discover these regularities on the basis of linguistic experience and make use of sublexical morphemic constituents in visual word recognition.}

After the initial choice, one of the nonchosen options is revealed as a losing option, and the individual can choose to stay with the original choice or switch to the other remaining option. Previous studies have found that most adults stay with their initial choice, although the chances of winning are 2/3 for switching and 1/3 for staying. Pigeons, college students, and preschool children were given many trials on this task to examine how their choices might change with experience. The college students began to switch on a majority of trials much sooner than the pigeons, contrary to the findings by Herbranson and Schroeder (2010) that pigeons perform better than people on this task. In all three groups, some individuals approximated the optimal strategy of switching on every trial, but most did not. Many of the preschoolers immediately showed a pattern of always switching or always staying and continued this pattern throughout the experiment. In a condition where the probability of winning was 90\% after a switch, all college students and all but one pigeon learned to switch on nearly every trial. The results suggest that one main impediment to learning the optimal strategy in the Monty Hall task, even after repeated trials, is the difficulty in discriminating the different reinforcement probabilities for switching versus staying.

Thus, the subunit vir takes on the role of a bound morpheme. In contrast, the words future and futile also share a subunit (fut), but are semantically unrelated. The reported experiment demonstrates facilitation in a masked priming experiment for the semantically related pairs that share an initial orthographic subunit (e.g., virus-viral), but not for the semantically unrelated pairs (e.g., future-futile). Whether the subunit was pronounced the same way in the prime and target was shown to be irrelevant. Furthermore, semantic relatedness was insufficient to produce priming when orthography was not shared. It was concluded that, while the units of processing within the orthographic system may be the same for the two types of item, their representation at a higher level may depend on the correlation between form with meaning. For example, virus and viral might share a higher level representation and thus facilitate each other, whereas future and futile might be represented separately at that higher level and even compete with each other.

The focus has been on how words are stored in the mental lexicon and retrieved during the reading process. If we possessed no mental lexicon, we would be unable to read. This book dedicates itself to a critical evaluation of the ideas that have emerged from this body of research. The book outlines the major models of lexical processing that have been put forward in the literature, and how they explain the basic empirical findings that have been reported. It then goes on to consider the possible influence that sentential context has on lexical processing, the impact of the pronunciation of a word on its visual processing, and the role played by internal word structure (i.e., syllables and morphemes) in the recognition of a word. A connectionist style of model emerges during the course of the evaluation of these issues. The book is suitable for advanced students and researchers, and is intended to serve as a springboard for discussion and an inspiration for empirical research.

Research in this area of inquiry has pursued causal explanations at the biological, cognitive, behavioral, and environmental levels of analysis (Vellutino, Fletcher, Snowling, \& Scanlon, 2004). Our primary concern in this chapter is to distinguish between manifest causes of early reading difficulties and underlying causes of such difficulties. We define manifest causes in terms of observed deficiencies in the knowledge and component skills the child must acquire in order to become a proficient reader and underlying causes in terms of biologically based cognitive deficits or environmental deficits that might impair the acquisition of those skills. Thus, we first define dyslexia and provide documentation of its primary behavioral manifestations. We proceed to discuss theories of dyslexia, specifying cognitive deficits presumed to underlie this disorder, and then go on to address the question of whether there are subtypes of dyslexia. We close with a brief discussion of research documenting the importance of distinguishing between reading problems caused primarily by biologically based cognitive deficits and reading problems caused primarily by experiential and instructional deficits.

The same result was shown in false positive responses to nonwords when their visibility was degraded through masking. In addition, these TL effects were just as strong for nonwords like nakpin as they were for nonwords whose medial consonants formed a complex coda like warlus, but whose baseword was syllabified between those consonants (e.g., the l and r of walrus). Such findings are a challenge for most current models of letter position assignment. Instead, they can be explained by an account where bisyllabic words are stored in lexical memory with a structure that maximizes the coda of the first syllable and where medial consonants are tried out in all viable subsyllabic slots.},

Early effects of visual complexity were seen around 50 ms after word onset, followed by the earliest sustained orthographic effects around 100 to 150 ms, with the bulk of orthographic and lexical influences arising after 200 ms. Effects of a semantic variable (concreteness) emerged later, at around 300 ms.

The present 3 studies, using a total of 88 undergraduates, examined spatial language processing when use of different reference frames results in ambiguity. This study investigated whether electrophysiological measures of cognitive processing may elucidate underlying reference frame processing; in particular, the authors were interested in semantic integration. Electrophysiological results show a larger N400, peaking between 300 and 375 ms, when the intrinsic frame was not used. Behavioral results mirrored this finding, indicating a reduced cognitive processing requirement for the intrinsic reference frame. Previous work has not definitively tied spatial reference frame processing to specific electrophysiological components and their associated cognitive processes. Although the N400 peak seen in this data is early, additional work supports the N400 interpretation, thereby linking spatial frame processing to semantic integration. Results are discussed within the larger context of spatial reference frame processing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2002 APA, all rights reserved).},

Ss viewed data 3 times, and were told about the nature and use of Chinese radicals before, early, late, or not at all. Results show that those told about radicals early in the data presentation process displayed the highest rate of word comprehension and retention. Those told about radicals at a late learning stage displayed no greater recall than did those never told about radicals. It is concluded that awareness of radicals facilitates Chinese character learning. The most effective way for novices to learn Chinese is to emphasize the radical structure of a character at initial presentation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2002 APA, all rights reserved).},

Bilingual children were equally proficient in both languages and were familiar with print and storybooks in both languages.

The general correspondence relation applies to all writing systems, but the specific correspondence relation changes for different kinds of writing systems. Bilingual children understood better than monolingual children the general symbolic representation of print. The older Chinese-English bilingual children also showed advanced understanding of the specific correspondence relations in English print.

How can we explain why some children with autism pass theory-of-mind tasks? Do deficits in theory of mind account for the major impairments that characterize autistic disorder?

In this chapter I provide an overview of how theory of mind deficits in autism may be intimately related to a broad range of language impairments, including not only pragmatics, but also lexical-semantics, and syntax. Research conducted over the past decade has highlighted some of these latter connections that may be considered at both general and more specific levels. These studies indicate that the relationship between understanding mind and language itself is much deeper than has previously been considered. Furthermore, the direction of this relationship is likely to be more complex when viewed from a developmental perspective. Throughout this chapter I consider the extent to which autism provides a window onto alternative ways in which mind and language may become connected over the course of development.},

These included Luria's (1966) tapping task, and a modified Stroop task, developed by Diamond and her colleagues (Gerstadt, Hong, \& Diamond, 1994). The main findings were that performance on the 2 executive function tasks was quite consistent, although some children had difficulty training on the tapping task. In contrast, there appeared to be no relation between performance on executive function tasks and false belief.

This property of metaphors is the basis for psycholinguistic comparison theories of metaphor comprehension. However, if metaphors cannot always be paraphrased as similes, then comparison theories must be abandoned. The different forms of a metaphor\textemdash the comparison and categorical forms\textemdash have different referents. In comparison form, the metaphor vehicle refers to the literal concept, e.g. `in my lawyer is like a shark', the term `shark' refers to the literal fish. In categorical form, `my lawyer is a shark', `shark' refers to an abstract (metaphorical) category of predatory creatures. This difference in reference makes it possible for a metaphor and its corresponding simile to differ (a) in interpretability and (b) in meaning. Because a metaphor cannot always be understood in terms of its corresponding simile, we conclude that comparison theories of metaphor are fundamentally flawed.},

The differences between feedforward and recurrent processing could prove pivotal in understanding the distinctions between attentive and pre-attentive vision as well as between conscious and unconscious vision. The feedforward sweep rapidly groups feature constellations that are hardwired in the visual brain, yet is probably incapable of yielding visual awareness; in many cases, recurrent processing is necessary before the features of an object are attentively grouped and the stimulus can enter consciousness.},

Moreover, the left hemisphere topography of the negativity resulted from component overlap between a centro-parietal N400 in some individuals and a right hemisphere-dominant P600 in others. Our results show that biphasic ERP waveforms do not always reflect separable processing stages within individuals, and moreover, that the LAN can be a variant of the N400.

Target words are more efficiently recognized when the transition probabilities between an initial fragment and the following segment in the target are high, but this effect is not equally distributed across all areas of the phonology. It was found that speakers rely more heavily on transition probabilities between segments of a consonant cluster than between segments of a consonant-vowel sequence. The morphemic integrity of the cluster is also a relevant parameter in predicting the role of probabilistic phonotactics in lexical access, with prefixed items showing a stronger facilitatory effect than pseudoprefixed items. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that phonotactic probabilities are relevant in visual word recognition, and that their effects interact with higher order linguistic information. These findings also enrich our view of the selection-and-competition mechanism that governs written word processing by providing direct evidence of the fact that the speakers anticipate the segment to the right based on implicit knowledge of phonotactic probabilities.},

Half of the target trials used opaque (end-palatalized) subject nouns, which were ambiguously marked for gender, and the other half used transparent (regularly marked) subject nouns. Noun type was crossed with the presence or absence of a gender-marked adjective in the subject NP. When an adjective was present in the subject NP, both L1 and L2 speakers were faster at reading and selecting the correct verb form. L2 but not L1 speakers showed longer reading and choice latencies and made more errors when the subject noun was opaque. The data showed that L2 speakers used adjective inflections to disambiguate the gender of opaque subject nouns and to select gender appropriate verb inflections.

We present a cognitive model of conceptual representations and processing\textemdash the Conceptual Structure Account (CSA; Tyler \& Moss, 2001)\textemdash as an example of a distributed, feature-based approach. In the first section, we describe the CSA and evaluate relevant neuropsychological and experimental behavioural data. We discuss studies using linguistic and nonlinguistic stimuli, which are both presumed to access the same conceptual system. We then take the CSA as a framework for hypothesising how conceptual knowledge is represented and processed in the brain. This neurocognitive approach attempts to integrate the distributed feature-based characteristics of the CSA with a distributed and feature-based model of sensory object processing. Based on a review of relevant functional imaging and neuropsychological data, we argue that distributed accounts of feature-based representations have considerable explanatory power, and that a cognitive model of conceptual representations is needed to understand their neural bases.},

Since one of the most important of those experiments had been poorly executed, a new version of the same study is presented with results that are entirely consistent with the previous one. However, logical problems exist with the view that says that stems act as access codes used to gain access to the lexicon, the main ones having to do with the fact that a prefix store is required. As a result, an alternative model is favoured, namely, an interactive-activation model. Prefixed words are represented in decomposed form in this model, but no prelexical prefix-stripping is required. A detailed examination is made of the manner in which this framework is able to incorporate the previous empirical results, as well as other aspects of morphological processing.},

The present research examined spatial description processing using an electrophysiological measure, event-related potentials (ERPs), using 20 college students for each experiment. ERP's fine-grained temporal resolution allows examination of cognitive processes as they unfold. A second behavioral study provides comparison results. This initial study indicates that spatial description comprehension relates to semantic integration. Given this interpretation, data also suggest multiple frame activation with then primary selection of the intrinsic reference frame. Results are discussed in a framework of comparing methodological techniques. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2002 APA, all rights reserved).},

Through the medium of sophisticated software interfaces users must navigate through cyberspace and access relevant information. Access to the user's mental model of the Internet will enable designers and information technologists to better understand and structure the knowledge deposits of the future. This study explores the use of drawings to access users' mental models of the Internet from a group of South African's with varying experience with the Internet and computers. Mental models from 51 University respondents were categorized by three independent raters. The mental models were arranged into six categories. Analyses on these categories suggest that the mental model categories may be hierarchically ordered according to respondents' experience with the Internet. These results are discussed in terms of the organization of knowledge on the Internet and in terms of designing Internet interfaces. Relevance to industry The results from this paper suggest that current windows-based Internet interfaces are not facilitating a deeper understanding of the underlying structure of the Internet, which may lead to users experiencing increasing navigation problems. Designers should therefore be considering embedding cues that facilitate accurate mental model formation into software interfaces.},

  abstract = {Conventionality and aptness are two dimensions of metaphorical sentences thought to play an important role in determining how quick and easy it is to process a metaphor. Conventionality reflects the familiarity of a metaphor whereas aptness reflects the degree to which a metaphor vehicle captures important features of a metaphor topic. In recent years it has become clear that operationalizing these two constructs is not as simple as asking na\"ive raters for subjective judgments. It has been found that ratings of aptness and conventionality are highly correlated, which has led some researchers to pursue alternative methods for measuring the constructs. Here, in four experiments, we explore the underlying reasons for the high correlation in ratings of aptness and conventionality, and question the construct validity of various methods for measuring the two dimensions. We find that manipulating the processing fluency of a metaphorical sentence by means of familiarization to similar senses of the metaphor (``in vivo conventionalization'') influences ratings of the sentence's aptness. This misattribution may help explain why subjective ratings of aptness and conventionality are highly correlated. In addition, we find other reasons to question the construct validity of conventionality and aptness measures: for instance, we find that conventionality is context dependent and thus not attributable to a metaphor vehicle alone, and we find that ratings of aptness take more into account than they should.}

Focusing predominantly on a comparison between Williams syndrome and Specific Language Impairment, we argue that the detailed level of behavioral fractionations observed in these disorders goes beyond the possible contribution of genes and implicates the developmental process as a key contributor to the cognitive outcome. Processes of compensation and interaction across development make highly specific developmental deficits unlikely; in line with this view, the actual level of specificity remains controversial, even in Specific Language Impairment (a paradigmatic example of a supposedly selective deficit). We consider the challenge of characterizing the atypical developmental process from the perspectives of brain development, cognitive development, and computational modeling. Failure to take up this challenge leaves many current explanations of developmental deficits ill-specified at best and implausible at worst.},

  abstract = {While an increasing number of behavioral studies suggest the importance of statistical learning in acquiring orthographic regularity across writing systems, no direct neural evidence supports this claim. The present study used event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate the time course and the neural correlate of statistical learning of positional consistency in Chinese orthography. Visual ERPs were recorded, while Chinese adults performed an orthographic statistical learning task involving artificial characters varying in high, moderate, and low levels of positional consistency. The negative ERP deflection at the N1 time window, typically linked with orthographic regularity processing, was found in orthographic statistical learning with the low and moderate consistencies eliciting larger neural responses than the high consistency in the time window of 150\textendash 210 ms over occipital\textendash temporal brain areas. These results suggest that orthographic statistical learning begins within the first 210 ms and that the N1 might be its neural indicator.},

To fill this gap, the present research manipulated the fluency of perceptual motor processes independently from sensory input and predicted that this increased fluency would result in increased aesthetic preference for stimulus movements that elicited the same motor movements as had been previously trained. Specifically, addressing the muscles that move the eyes, I trained participants to follow a stimulus movement without actually seeing it. Experiment 1 demonstrated that ocular-muscle training resulted in the predicted increase in preference for trained stimulus movements compared with untrained stimulus movements, although participants had not previously seen any of the movements. Experiments 2 and 3 showed that actual motor matching and not perceptual similarity drove this effect. Thus, beauty may be not only in the eye of the beholder, but also in the eyes' movements.

  abstract = {We consider three theories that have dominated discussions of metaphor. One view is that metaphors make comparisons, the basis for the comparison being the features (or categories) that the terms of the metaphor share. The second view is that metaphors involve an anomaly. The third view is that metaphors are `interactive', producing a new way of seeing the terms. We propose a new theory\textemdash the domains-interaction view\textemdash that draws on elements of all three earlier views, but borrows especially from the interaction view. We consider the implications of our theory for three questions: What are metaphors? How are they understood? What makes a good metaphor? We argue that metaphors correlate two systems of concepts from different domains. The best metaphors involve two diverse domains (more distance between domains making for better metaphors) and close correspondence between the terms within those domains. We call the degree of correspondence within-domain similarity. Metaphors are interpreted in several stages: the terms of the metaphor are encoded; the domains involved are inferred; the structures to be seen as parallel are found; the correspondences between these structures are `mapped' or constructed; the terms of the metaphor are compared. If the terms are not seen to match or occupy analogous roles in their different domains, then the metaphor may be reinterpreted. The evidence on all this is tentative but supports our view. We review two studies (Tourangeau and Sternberg, 1981) that support the hypothesis that distance within domain relates negatively to aptness, whereas distance between domains relates positively. Several studies on comprehension tend to disconfirm the comparison theory's notion that the tenor and vehicle necessarily share features. Tenor and vehicle also appear to have asymmetrical roles in the interpretive process. R\'esum\'e On consid\`ere trois th\'eories qui ont domin\'e les discussions sur les metaphores. Dans la premi\`ere on soutient que les m\'etaphores fond des comparaisons dont les bases sont les traits (ou cat\'egories) que les termes de la m\'etaphore partagent. Dans la seconde les m\'etaphores impliquent une anomalie. Dans la troisi\`eme les m\'etaphores sont vues comme `interactives' et produisant une nouvelle fa\c{c}on de voir les termes. Nous proposons une nouvelle th\'eorie: le point de vue interaction-domaine qui s'appuie sur certains \'el\'ements des trois points de vue pr\'ec\'edents mais plus particuli\`erement sur l'interaction. Nous consid\'erons les implications de notre th\'eorie sur trois points: Que sont les m\'etaphores? Comment sont-elles comprises? Qu'est ce qui fait une bonne m\'etaphore? Nous pensons que les m\'etaphores corr\`elent deux syst\`emes de concepts de domaines diff\'erents. Les meilleures m\'etaphores impliquent deux domaines diff\'erents (plus la distance entre ces domaines est grande plus les m\'etaphores sont bonnes) et une correspondance proche entre les termes \`a l'int\'erieur de ces domaines. Nous appellons le degr\'e de correspondance similarit\'e d'intra domaine. Les m\'etaphores sont interpr\'et\'ees \`a diff\'erents stades: encodage des termes de la m\'etaphore, inf\'erence des domaines impliqu\'es d\'ecouverte des structures parall\`eles, `projection' ou construction des correspondances entre ces structures puis comparaison des termes de la m\'etaphore. Si l'on ne consi\`ere pas les termes comme appari\'es ou ayant des r\^oles analogues dans les domaines diff\'erents, la m\'etaphore doit \^etre reinterpr\'et\'ee. Les preuves de ceci en sont encore au stade exp\'erimental mais vont dans notre sens. Nous passons en revue deux \'etudes (Tourangeau et Sternberg, 1981) qui appuient l'hypoth\`ese que la distance \`a l'int\'erieur des domaines est n\'egativement reli\'ee \`a l'ad\'equation tandis que la distance entre les domaines est reli\'ee positivement. Plusieurs \'etudes de compr\'ehension vom \`a l'encontre de la notion th\'eorique de comparaison impliquant que le contenu et le v\'ehicule partagent n\'ecessairement des traits. La signification et le v\'ehicule semblent blent avoir plut\^ot des r\^oles sym\'etriques dans le processus d'interpr\'etation.},

Data from children with and without dyslexia show the usefulness of morphemic parsing to improve fluency and comprehension. The results are interpreted in the light of Grainger \& Ziegler's (2011) proposal. It can be considered an interesting framework to model reading processes, as it offers an integrate view of reading acquisition, in which even morphological awareness can play an important role along with orthographic and phonological components. Some examples of training interventions aimed at improving the use of morphemic constituents in children with reading difficulties are presented and discussed.},

This article reports 2 eye-tracking experiments investigating the effects of a prime sentence on the processing of a target sentence that shared aspects of syntactic form. The experiments were designed to determine the degree to which lexical overlap between prime and target sentences produced larger effects, comparable to the widely observed ``lexical boost'' in production experiments (Pickering \& Branigan, 1998; Pickering \& Ferreira, 2008). The current experiments showed that priming effects during online comprehension were in fact larger when a verb was repeated across the prime and target sentences (see also Tooley et al., 2009). The finding of larger priming effects with lexical repetition supports accounts under which syntactic form representations are connected to individual lexical items (e.g., Tomasello, 2003; Vosse \& Kempen, 2000, 2009).

We conducted two experiments with participants ranging in reading level from early elementary school to university to study the development of context use. Experiment 1 focused on adjacent context, and Experiment 2 also examined nonadjacent context. Use of context developed slowly, and readers at all levels were not as influenced by it as would be expected given the contextual effects in the English vocabulary.

Method The tutorial begins with a discussion of statistical learning and its characteristics. It then discusses research on how statistical learning plays out in learning to spell, how spelling should be taught, and similarities and differences among learners. The focus is on the learning of English, although studies of other alphabetic writing systems are also considered. Research shows that, from an early age, children use their statistical learning skills to learn about the visual characteristics of written words. Children also use their statistical learning skills to help learn about the relations between visual units and units of language, supplementing what they are explicitly taught in school. Conclusion Statistical learning plays an important role in learning to spell, and this can help to explain why some aspects of spelling are more difficult to learn than others. If children are to learn to spell effectively and efficiently, structured instruction is also important.}

Organisms use favourable seasons to reproduce and grow, and withdraw during unfavourable seasons. To deal with the predictable changes in their environments, all taxonomic groups have evolved genetically programmed timing mechanisms. These govern seasonal cycles in physiology and behaviour that optimise survival and reproductive success, and have been formally described as circannual rhythms. Experimentally, under conditions of constant day length and temperature, circannual rhythms of many species continue to be expressed, even throughout the life cycle, illustrating the fundamental endogenous control. Under natural conditions, they are usually entrained by seasonal time cues, notably photoperiod, to synchronise the biology to environmental periodicity. Here we review long-term timekeeping strategies from classical vertebrate models to invertebrate and unicell life histories. These circannual rhythms enable organisms to anticipate Earth's periodicity.},

A selective attention paradigm and a masking paradigm were used to compare the perception of faces with the perception of inverted faces, words, and houses. Evidence was found of relatively less part-based shape representation for faces.

Several predictions of the contrast model are tested in studies of similarity with both semantic and perceptual stimuli. The model is used to uncover, analyze, and explain a variety of empirical phenomena such as the role of common and distinctive features, the relations between judgments of similarity and difference, the presence of asymmetric similarities, and the effects of context on judgments of similarity. The contrast model generalizes standard representations of similarity data in terms of clusters and trees. It is also used to analyze the relations of prototypicality and family resemblance.

These heuristics are highly economical and usually effective, but they lead to systematic and predictable errors. A better understanding of these heuristics and of the biases to which they lead could improve judgements and decisions in situations of uncertainty.},

  abstract = {Four experiments tested whether and how initially planned but then abandoned speech can influence the production of a subsequent resumption. Participants named initial pictures, which were sometimes suddenly replaced by target pictures that were related in meaning or word form or were unrelated. They then had to stop and resume with the name of the target picture. Target picture naming latencies were measured separately for trials in which the initial speech was skipped, interrupted, or completed. Semantically related initial pictures helped the production of the target word, although the effect dissipated once the utterance of the initial picture name had been completed. In contrast, phonologically related initial pictures hindered the production of the target word, but only for trials in which the name of the initial picture had at least partly been uttered. This semantic facilitation and phonological interference did not depend on the time interval between the initial and target picture, which was either varied between 200 ms and 400 ms (Experiments 1,\"A\`i2) or was kept constant at 300 ms (Experiments 3,\"A\`i4). We discuss the implications of these results for models of speech self-monitoring and for models of problem-free word production.

  abstract = {The role of sensory-motor systems in conceptual understanding has been controversial. It has been proposed that many abstract concepts are understood metaphorically through concrete sensory-motor domains such as actions. Using fMRI, we compared neural responses with literal action (Lit; The daughter grasped the flowers), metaphoric action (Met; The public grasped the idea), and abstract (Abs; The public understood the idea) sentences of varying familiarity. Both Lit and Met sentences activated the left anterior inferior parietal lobule, an area involved in action planning, with Met sentences also activating a homologous area in the right hemisphere, relative to Abs sentences. Both Met and Abs sentences activated the left superior temporal regions associated with abstract language. Importantly, activation in primary motor and biological motion perception regions was inversely correlated with Lit and Met familiarity. These results support the view that the understanding of metaphoric action retains a link to sensory-motor systems involved in action performance. However, the involvement of sensory-motor systems in metaphor understanding changes through a gradual abstraction process whereby relatively detailed simulations are used for understanding unfamiliar metaphors, and these simulations become less detailed and involve only secondary motor regions as familiarity increases. Consistent with these data, we propose that anterior inferior parietal lobule serves as an interface between sensory-motor and conceptual systems and plays an important role in both domains. The similarity of abstract and metaphoric sentences in the activation of left superior temporal regions suggests that action metaphor understanding is not completely based on sensory-motor simulations but relies also on abstract lexical-semantic codes.},

However, recent studies have challenged this position by reporting highly automatic ERP effects for morphosyntax in the 100 to 200 msec time range. The present study aimed at determining the factors that could contribute to such shifts in latency and automaticity. In two experiments varying the degree of attention, German phrase structure and morphosyntactic violations were compared in conditions in which the locality of the violated syntactic relation, as well as the violation point and the acoustic properties of the speech stimuli, were strictly controlled for. A negativity between 100 and 300 msec after the violation point occurred in response to both types of syntactic violations and independently of the allocation of attentional resources. These findings suggest that the timing and automaticity of ERP effects reflecting specific syntactic subprocesses are influenced to a larger degree by methodological than by linguistic factors, and thus, need to be regarded as relative rather than fixed to temporally successive processing stages.},

Differences in lexical structure, in the form of the regular and irregular past tense, have proven to be critical in this debate by contrasting a highly predictable rule-like process (e.g., jump-jumped) with an unpredictable idiosyncratic process typified by the irregulars (e.g., think-thought). The key issue raised by these contrasts is whether processing regular and irregular past tense forms differentially engages different aspects of the neural language system or whether they are processed within a single system that distinguishes between them purely on the basis of phonological and semantic differences. The correlational analyses provide clear evidence for a functional differentiation between different brain regions associated with the processing of lexical form, meaning, and morphological structure.},

  abstract = {The double dissociation between the regular and irregular past tense in English has been explained in terms of dual and single mechanism accounts. In previous research we have argued that problems with the regular past tense in patients with left inferior frontal damage arise from morpho-phonological parsing difficulties [Trends in Cognitive Science 2 (1998) 428]. This claim has recently been challenged by a single mechanism connectionist account which argues that a general phonological processing deficit causes the poor performance on the regular past tense, with morphological factors playing no explicit role [Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 96 (1999) 7592]. We used a speeded judgement task with four patients who have documented difficulties with the regular past tense to contrast the claims made by these different approaches. We compared patients' ability to detect the difference between the past tense and stem of regular (hugged/hug) and irregular (taught/teach) past tense verbs, as well as matched ``pseudo'' pairs (trade/tray and port/peach). These real word conditions were accompanied by matched sets of non-words (e.g. nugged/nug). Patients' latencies to the regular past tense real word-pairs were consistently slower than in any other condition. To test for a general phonological processing deficit, we conducted several tests of phonological processing ability. The results show that the patients had a range of difficulties in phonological processing, from very mild to severe. This did not correlate with their performance on the speeded judgement task. We interpret this pattern of results as support for a specialised morpho-phonological processing mechanism which can be dissociated from other phonological processes and which is used directly in the processing of the regular past tense in a dual-mechanism system.},

Some of the discrepancies in results regarding the time course of orthographic and phonological activation in word recognition research may be due to this factor. This hypothesis was examined by manipulating parametrically the luminance of the prime and its exposure duration, measuring their joint impact on masked repetition priming. The results show that small and non-significant priming effects can be more than tripled as a result of simply increasing luminance, when SOA is kept constant. Moreover, increased luminance may compensate for briefer exposure duration and vice versa.},

  abstract = {We present a neural network model of learning and processing the English past tense that is based on the notion that experience-dependent cortical development is a core aspect of cognitive development. During learning the model adds and removes units and connections to develop a task-specific final architecture. The model provides an integrated account of characteristic errors during learning the past tense, adult generalization to pseudoverbs, and dissociations between verbs observed after brain damage in aphasic patients. We put forward a theory of verb inflection in which a functional processing architecture develops through interactions between experience-dependent brain development and the structure of the environment, in this case, the statistical properties of verbs in the language. The outcome of this process is a structured processing system giving rise to graded dissociations between verbs that are easy and verbs that are hard to learn and process. In contrast to dual-mechanism accounts of inflection, we argue that describing dissociations as a dichotomy between regular and irregular verbs is a post hoc abstraction and is not linked to underlying processing mechanisms. We extend current single-mechanism accounts of inflection by highlighting the role of structural adaptation in development and in the formation of the adult processing system. In contrast to some single-mechanism accounts, we argue that the link between irregular inflection and verb semantics is not causal and that existing data can be explained on the basis of phonological representations alone. This work highlights the benefit of taking brain development seriously in theories of cognitive development. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Excitotoxicity, the specific type of neurotoxicity mediated by glutamate, may be the missing link between ischemia and neuronal death, and intervening the mechanistic steps that lead to excitotoxicity can prevent stroke damage. Interest in excitotoxicity began fifty years ago when monosodium glutamate was found to be neurotoxic. Evidence soon demonstrated that glutamate is not only the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the adult brain, but also a critical transmitter for signaling neurons to degenerate following stroke. The finding led to a number of clinical trials that tested inhibitors of excitotoxicity in stroke patients. Glutamate exerts its function in large by activating the calcium-permeable ionotropic NMDA receptor (NMDAR), and different subpopulations of the NMDAR may generate different functional outputs, depending on the signaling proteins directly bound or indirectly coupled to its large cytoplasmic tail. Synaptic activity activates the GluN2A subunit-containing NMDAR, leading to activation of the pro-survival signaling proteins Akt, ERK, and CREB. During a brief episode of ischemia, the extracellular glutamate concentration rises abruptly, and stimulation of the GluN2B-containing NMDAR in the extrasynaptic sites triggers excitotoxic neuronal death via PTEN, cdk5, and DAPK1, which are directly bound to the NMDAR, nNOS, which is indirectly coupled to the NMDAR via PSD95, and calpain, p25, STEP, p38, JNK, and SREBP1, which are further downstream. This review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of the literature on excitotoxicity and our perspectives on how the new generation of excitotoxicity inhibitors may succeed despite the failure of the previous generation of drugs.},

To test these competing theories, acceptability ratings were elicited from 23 native English-speaking undergraduates for regular and irregular past-tense forms, and their stems, in sentence contexts. Partialling out stem ratings, ratings of irregular past-tense forms correlated with their frequencies and with measures of the number of similar-sounding irregular verbs, whereas ratings of regular part-tense forms did not correlate with their frequencies or with measures of the number of similar-sounding regular verbs.

  abstract = {The structure of the brain and the nature of evolution suggest that, despite its uniqueness, language likely depends on brain systems that also subserve other functions. The declarative/procedural (DP) model claims that the mental lexicon of memorized word-specific knowledge depends on the largely temporal-lobe substrates of declarative memory, which underlies the storage and use of knowledge of facts and events. The mental grammar, which subserves the rule-governed combination of lexical items into complex representations, depends on a distinct neural system. The functions of the two brain systems, together with their anatomical, physiological and biochemical substrates, lead to specific claims and predictions regarding their roles in language. Empirical evidence is presented from neuroimaging studies of normal language processing, and from developmental and adult-onset disorders. It is argued that this evidence supports the DP model. It is additionally proposed that "language" disorders, such as specific language impairment and non-fluent and fluent aphasia, may be profitably viewed as impairments primarily affecting one or the other brain system. Overall, the data suggest a new neurocognitive framework for the study of lexicon and grammar. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2006 APA, all rights reserved).},

Patients produced past tenses of regular and novel verbs (looked and plagged), which require an -ed-suffixation rule, and irregular verbs (dug), which are retrieved from memory. Word-finding difficulties in posterior aphasia, and the general declarative memory impairment in Alzheimer's disease, led to more errors with irregular than regular and novel verbs. Grammatical difficulties in anterior aphasia, and the general impairment of procedures in Parkinson's disease, led to the opposite pattern. In contrast to the Parkinson's patients, who showed sup pressed motor activity and rule use, Huntington's disease patients showed excess motor activity and rule use, underscoring a role for the basal ganglia in grammatical processing.},

However, to understand expressions like ``he did it'' or ``the little girl'', combining word meanings in accordance with semantic and syntactic constraints is not enough\textemdash readers and listeners also need to work out what or who is being referred to. We review our event-related brain potential research on the processes involved in establishing reference, and present a new experiment in which we examine when and how the implicit causality associated with specific interpersonal verbs affects the interpretation of a referentially ambiguous pronoun. The evidence suggests that upon encountering a singular noun or pronoun, readers and listeners immediately inspect their situation model for a suitable discourse entity, such that they can discriminate between having too many, too few, or exactly the right number of referents within at most half a second. Furthermore, our implicit causality findings indicate that a fragment like ``David praised Linda because\ldots '' can immediately foreground a particular referent, to the extent that a subsequent ``he'' is at least initially construed as a syntactic error. In all, our brain potential findings suggest that referential processing is highly incremental, and not necessarily contingent upon the syntax. In addition, they demonstrate that we can use ERPs to relatively selectively keep track of how readers and listeners establish reference.},

Subjects listened to stories in which a particular noun phrase like ``the girl'' either uniquely referred to a single referent mentioned in the earlier discourse, or ambiguously referred to two equally suitable referents. Referentially ambiguous nouns (``the girl'' with two girls introduced in the discourse context) elicited a frontally dominant and sustained negative shift in brain potentials, emerging within 300\textendash 400 ms after acoustic noun onset. The early onset of this effect reveals that reference to a discourse entity can be established very rapidly. Its morphology and distribution suggest that at least some of the processing consequences of referential ambiguity may involve an increased demand on memory resources. Furthermore, because this referentially induced ERP effect is very different from that of well-known ERP effects associated with the semantic (N400) and syntactic (e.g., P600/SPS) aspects of language comprehension, it suggests that ERPs can be used to selectively keep track of three major processes involved in the comprehension of an unfolding piece of discourse.},

  abstract = {A link has been suggested between children's disconnection from nature and the recent surge in childhood disorders such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Research on benefits of nature for healthy children provides some support for such a link. However, only a few studies have directly examined the influence of contact with nature on children with ADHD. The aim of the present research was to gain more insight into the behaviour and emotional and cognitive functioning of children with ADHD in a natural and built setting. Two groups of six children (age 9-17) who stayed at care farms for children with ADHD in the Netherlands were systematically observed, questioned, and tested during visits to a wooded area and a small town. Both groups performed better on a concentration task in the woods than in the town, despite the fact that all children visited the town after the woods and thus their scores in the town were possibly inflated by learning effects. However, the behaviour and emotional functioning in the two settings differed between the groups. One group of children liked the woods better than the town and displayed more positive behaviours and feelings in the natural environment. The other group of children liked the town equally well as the woods and displayed positive behaviours and feelings in both settings, although they showed somewhat more non-social, aggressive, inattentive, impulsive and hyperactive behaviour in the town than in the woods. These results suggest that natural areas provide a consistent positive environment for children with ADHD. However, more research is needed to obtain a fuller understanding of the influences of the physical environment on children with ADHD.},

Here, we propose a novel automatic pipeline (APP) for pre-processing and artifact rejection of EEG data, which innovates relative to existing methods by not only following state-of-the-art guidelines but also further employing robust statistics. Methods APP was tested on event-related potential (ERP) data from healthy participants and schizophrenia patients, and resting-state (RS) data from healthy participants. Its performance was compared with that of existing automatic methods (FASTER for ERP data, TAPEEG and Prep pipeline for RS data) and supervised pre-processing by experts. Results APP rejected fewer bad channels and bad epochs than the other methods. In the ERP study, it produced significantly higher amplitudes than FASTER, which were consistent with the supervised scheme. In the RS study, it produced spectral measures that correlated well with the automatic alternatives and the supervised scheme. Conclusion APP effectively removed EEG artifacts, performing similarly to the supervised scheme and outperforming existing automatic alternatives. Significance The proposed automatic pipeline provides a reliable and efficient tool for pre-processing large datasets of both evoked and resting-state EEG.},

The claim of the DP framework is that such behavior is necessary to achieve high levels of expert performance. The proponents of the framework reject evidence that suggests that other variables are also necessary to achieve high levels of expert performance, or they claim that the relationship between those variables and expert performance is mediated by DP. Therefore, the DP framework also implies that DP is sufficient to achieve high levels of expert performance. We test these claims by reviewing studies on chess expertise. We found strong evidence that abundant DP is necessary (but not sufficient) and estimated that the minimum requirement to achieve master level is 3,000 hours of DP. We also review evidence showing that other factors play a role in chess skill: general cognitive abilities, sensitive period, handedness, and season of birth.},

Dutch-English bilinguals associated twice to nouns and verbs that varied on concreteness and cognate status, once in the language of the stimuli (within-language), and once in the other language (between-language). Within- and between-language associations for concrete words and for cognates were more often translations of one another than those for abstract words and noncognates, and nouns evoked more translations than verbs. In both within- and between-language association, retrieving an associate was easier to concrete than to abstract words, to cognates than to noncognates, and to nouns than to verbs. These findings suggest that conceptual representation in bilingual memory depends on word-type and grammatical class: concrete translations, cognates, and noun translations more often share, or share larger parts of, a conceptual representation than abstract translations, noncognates, and verb translations. The results are discussed within the framework of distributed memory representation.},

Type frequency is taken to reflect the lexicon, token frequency language use. Type and token frequencies were compared for a total of 10 basic distinctions at the phonological, morphological, lexical and lexico-syntactic levels in English. These include consonants vs. vowels, prefixes vs. suffixes, count vs. mass nouns and transitive vs. intransitive verbs. The empirical analysis reveals that type frequencies may be more, or less, extreme than token frequencies. Non-phonological distinctions evince a higher discrepancy between type and token frequency than phonological ones. In addition, complexity is more strongly discouraged in token than in type frequency, suggesting that it is more of an issue in processing than in storage. It is concluded that the lexicon constrains language use, though only to a limited extent.},

Furthermore, while TD children who passed the ToM task looked longer at the original hiding place there was no such contrast in the clinical groups.

However, there is very little direct evidence to date supporting such a link between implicit statistical learning and language. In three experiments using novel methods of assessing implicit learning and language abilities, we show that sensitivity to sequential structure \textendash{} as measured by improvements to immediate memory span for structurally-consistent input sequences \textendash{} is significantly correlated with the ability to use knowledge of word predictability to aid speech perception under degraded listening conditions. Importantly, the association remained even after controlling for participant performance on other cognitive tasks, including short-term and working memory, intelligence, attention and inhibition, and vocabulary knowledge. Thus, the evidence suggests that implicit learning abilities are essential for acquiring long-term knowledge of the sequential structure of language \textendash{} i.e., knowledge of word predictability \textendash{} and that individual differences on such abilities impact speech perception in everyday situations. These findings provide a new theoretical rationale linking basic learning phenomena to specific aspects of spoken language processing in adults, and may furthermore indicate new fruitful directions for investigating both typical and atypical language development.},

Monolingual English speakers also showed facilitation due to English neighbors, but no effect of Dutch neighbors. The experiments provide evidence for parallel activation of words in an integrated Dutch/English lexicon.

By building a publicly accessible repository of raw data from peer\textendash reviewed studies, the Data Center hopes to create a similarly successful environment for the neurosciences.

Next, we detail the organization, design and foundation of the fMRIDC, ranging from its current capabilities to the issues involved in the submitting and requesting of data. We discuss how a publicly accessible database enables other fields to develop relevant tools that can aid in the growth of understanding of cognitive processes. Information retrieval and meta\textendash analytic techniques can be used to search, sort and categorize study information with a view towards subjecting study data to secondary `meta\textendash ' and `mega\textendash analyses'. In addition, we detail the technical and policy challenges that have had to be addressed in the formation of the Data Center. Among others, these include: human subject confidentiality issues; ensuring investigator's rights; heterogeneous data description and organization; development of search tools; and data transfer issues. We conclude with comments concerning the future of the fMRIDC effort, its role in promoting the sharing of neuroscientific data, and how this may alter the manner in which studies are published.},

The experiments used different measures of theory of mind ability, including false belief (Exp 1), explanation of action (Exp 2), and recognition of emotional expressions (Exp 3). In none of these experiments did the children with Williams syndrome evidence superior performance compared to the control groups. Results support the view that the social-cognitive and social-perceptual components of a theory of mind are dissociable. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

In a long-term study population, we used parentage analysis based on 21 microsatellite markers to describe, for the first time, variance in male lifetime breeding success (LBS) of roe deer, a territorial ungulate where males weigh less than 10\% more than females. LBS ranged from 0 to 14 (mean = 4.54, variance = 15.5), and its distribution was highly skewed, with only a few males obtaining high LBS and many males failing to breed or siring only one fawn. As predicted for polygynous species with low sexual size dimorphism, the standardized variance in male LBS was low (Im = 0.75) and was only slightly higher than the standardized variance in female LRS (If = 0.53), suggesting a low opportunity for sexual selection. The Im value reported here for roe deer is much lower than values reported for highly dimorphic ungulates such as red deer (Im \&gt; 3). We suggest that, along a continuum of opportunity for sexual selection, roe deer occupy a position closer to monogamous and monomorphic territorial ungulates than to highly polygynous, sexually dimorphic ungulates with dominance rank\textendash based mating systems such as harems or roving mating systems.},

We studied the neural correlates of the processing of inflected nouns in the morphologically rich Finnish language. Previous behavioral studies in Finnish have yielded a robust inflectional processing cost, i.e., inflected words are harder to recognize than otherwise matched morphologically simple words. Theoretically this effect could stem either from decomposition of inflected words into a stem and a suffix at input level and/or from subsequent recombination at the semantic\textendash syntactic level to arrive at an interpretation of the word. To shed light on this issue, we used magnetoencephalography to reveal the time course and localization of neural effects of morphological structure and frequency of written words. Ten subjects silently read high- and low-frequency Finnish words in inflected and monomorphemic form. Morphological complexity was accompanied by stronger and longer-lasting activation of the left superior temporal cortex from 200 ms onwards. Earlier effects of morphology were not found, supporting the view that the well-established behavioral processing cost for inflected words stems from the semantic\textendash syntactic level rather than from early decomposition. Since the effect of morphology was detected throughout the range of word frequencies employed, the majority of inflected Finnish words appears to be represented in decomposed form and only very high-frequency inflected words may acquire full-form representations.

An experimenter read an illustrated story about a target character. Participants were asked to verbally repeat the story to measure spontaneous pronoun use and then to explicitly recall the characters' pronouns. In Study 1 the story characters had typically feminine or typically masculine appearances (determined by independent raters), whereas in Study 2 the characters had gender-neutral appearances. In both studies, targets were referred to with gendered or gender-neutral pronouns. In both studies, children more accurately recalled gendered pronouns than gender-neutral pronouns. However, on most tasks, children only used ``they'' if a character had gender-neutral pronouns, and almost never used ``they'' if a character had gendered pronouns. We also found some evidence suggesting that older children more accurately recall gender-neutral pronouns compared with younger children.},

  abstract = {We examined the effects of letter-transposition in Hebrew in three masked-priming experiments. Hebrew, like English has an alphabetic orthography where sequential and contiguous letter strings represent phonemes. However, being a Semitic language it has a non-concatenated morphology that is based on root derivations. Experiment 1 showed that transposed-letter (TL) root primes inhibited responses to targets derived from the non-transposed root letters, and that this inhibition was unrelated to relative root frequency. Experiment 2 replicated this result and showed that if the transposed letters of the root created a nonsense-root that had no lexical representation, then no inhibition and no facilitation were obtained. Finally, Experiment 3 demonstrated that in contrast to English, French, or Spanish, TL nonword primes did not facilitate recognition of targets, and when the root letters embedded in them consisted of a legal root morpheme, they produced inhibition. These results suggest that lexical space in alphabetic orthographies may be structured very differently in different languages if their morphological structure diverges qualitatively. In Hebrew, lexical space is organized according to root families rather than simple orthographic structure, so that all words derived from the same root are interconnected or clustered together, independent of overall orthographic similarity.},

  abstract = {Background: Neuroimaging offers unique opportunities for understanding the acquisition of reading by children and for unravelling the mystery of developmental dyslexia. Here, I provide a selective overview of recent neuroimaging studies, drawing out implications for education and the teaching of reading. Purpose: The different neuroimaging technologies available offer complementary techniques for revealing the biological basis of reading and dyslexia. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is most suited to localisation of function, and hence to investigating the neural networks that underpin efficient (or inefficient) reading. Electroencephalography (EEG) is sensitive to millisecond differences in timing, hence it is suited to studying the time course of processing; for example, it can reveal when networks relevant to phonology versus semantics are activated. Magnetic source imaging (MSI) gives information about both location in the brain and the time course of activation. I illustrate how each technology is most suited to answering particular questions about the core neural systems for reading, and how these systems interact, and what might go wrong in the dyslexic brain. Design and methods: Following a brief overview of behavioural studies of reading acquisition in different languages, selected neuroimaging studies of typical development are discussed and analysed. Those studies including the widest age ranges of children have been selected. Neuroimaging studies of developmental dyslexia are then reviewed, focusing on (a) the neural networks recruited for reading, (b) the time course of neural activation and (c) the neural effects of remediation. Representative studies using the different methodologies are selected. It is shown that studies converge in showing that the dyslexic brain is characterised by under-activation of the key neural networks for reading. Conclusions: Different neuroimaging methods can contribute different kinds of data relevant to key questions in education. The most informative studies with respect to causation will be longitudinal prospective studies, which are currently rare.},

The prevailing inhibition hypothesis takes larger reaction-time (RT) costs for switching to the first language (L1) than to the second language (L2) as evidence for suppression of the non-target language. Switch cost asymmetries can alternatively be explained by an L1-repeat-benefit, assuming selective absence of language competition in repeating L1. To test the latter hypothesis, RTs and event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded when unbalanced Dutch\textendash English bilinguals switched between overt picture naming in L1 and L2. Preparation time (short versus long cue\textendash stimulus intervals) modulated the degree to which top-down inhibitory control biased language competition, as indexed by the N2 component of the ERP. RT switch costs were asymmetrical on short intervals and symmetrical on long intervals. Preparation interval effects were observed in all conditions except for L1 repeat trials. This pattern was present both for RT and N2 data, thereby supporting the L1-repeat-benefit hypothesis.

  abstract = {The purpose of this volume is to present recent research in the field of the acquisition of functional literacy and its precursors. The volume aims to capture the state of the art in this rapidly expanding field. An attempt is made to clarify the vague and often inconsistent definitions of functional literacy from the perspective of development. Cognitive, linguistic, educational, and social factors of literacy development are all taken into account. The volume consists of three subsequent parts. The first part goes into phonological precursors of literacy development. In this part the focus is on the development of early language precursors of of reading and writing. The cultural foundations of these precursors are explored, and their links with reading development are dealt with in detail. Different psycholinguistic approaches are also proposed to explain the occurrence of literacy problems. In the second part, the scope is on the constraints of reading and writing efficiency at the word level and beyond. The acquisition of reading and writing is seen as a result from the interaction between phonological, orthographic, and semantic processes. A crosslinguistic perspective is taken on the role of writing system factors in the acquisition of literacy skills. The final part deals with the role of social and educational factors in literacy acquisition. Starting from a crosscultural perspective, the central issue is how the attainment of functional literacy is dependent on sociocultural variation. The predictors of more advanced levels of literacy development are considered, including foreign language literacy and adult literacy.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the relation between working memory span and syllogistic reasoning performance. In addition, performance for the reasoning task was compared to predictions made by mental model theory and the probability heuristics model. According to mental model theory, syllogisms that require the use of more mental models are more difficult. According to the probability heuristics model difficulty is related to the number of probabilistic heuristics that must be applied, or (for invalid syllogisms) inconsistencies between the derived and correct conclusion. The predictions of these theories were examined across two experiments. In general, people with larger working memory capacities reasoned better. Also, the responses made by people with larger capacities were more likely to correspond to the predictions made by both mental model theory and the probability heuristics model. Relations between working memory span and performance were also consistent with both theories.},

  abstract = {The human brain has the fascinating ability to represent and to process several languages. Although the first and further languages activate partially different brain networks, the linguistic factors underlying these differences in language processing have to be further specified. We investigated the neural correlates of language proficiency in a homogeneous sample of multilingual native Ladin speakers from a mountain valley in South Tyrol, Italy, who speak Italian as second language at a high level, and English at an intermediate level. In a constrained word production task under functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), participants had to name pictures of objects in Ladin, Italian and English in separate blocks. Overall, multilingual word production activated a common set of brain areas dedicated to known subcomponents of picture naming. In comparison to English, the fluently spoken languages Ladin and Italian were associated with enhanced right prefrontal activity. In addition, the MR signal in right prefrontal cortex correlated with naming accuracy as a measure of language proficiency. Our results demonstrate the significance of right prefrontal areas for language proficiency. Based on the role of these areas for cognitive control, our findings suggest that right prefrontal cortex supports language proficiency by effectively supervising word retrieval.},

  abstract = {Background The purpose of the present study was to examine, first, whether hearing acuity predicts falls and whether the potential association is explained by postural balance and, second, to examine whether shared genetic or environmental effects underlie these associations. Methods Hearing was measured using a clinical audiometer as a part of the Finnish Twin Study on Aging in 103 monozygotic and 114 dizygotic female twin pairs aged 63\textendash 76 years. Postural balance was indicated as a center of pressure (COP) movement in semitandem stance, and participants filled in a fall-calendar daily for an average of 345 days after the baseline. Results Mean hearing acuity (better ear hearing threshold level at 0.5\textendash 4 kHz) was 21 dB (standard deviation [SD] 12). Means of the COP velocity moment for the best to the poorest hearing quartiles increased linearly from 40.7 mm2/s (SD 24.4) to 52.8 mm2/s (SD 32.0) (p value for the trend = .003). Altogether 199 participants reported 437 falls. Age-adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for falls, with the best hearing quartile as a reference, were 1.2 (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.4\textendash 3.8) in the second, 4.1 (95\% CI = 1.1\textendash 15.6) in the third, and 3.4 (95\% CI = 1.0\textendash 11.4) in the poorest hearing quartiles. Adjustment for COP velocity moment decreased IRRs markedly. Twin analyses showed that the association between hearing acuity and postural balance was not explained by genetic factors in common for these traits. Conclusion People with poor hearing acuity have a higher risk for falls, which is partially explained by their poorer postural control. Auditory information about environment may be important for safe mobility.},

The reading-time data showed that the syntactic violation was detected earlier than the semantic one and that the two violations differed in the time-course. The ERP data fully supported the reading time data: Syntactic anomalies elicited a left anterior negativity (LAN) and a P600. Semantic anomalies elicited a N400 centred on the parietal sites which started 90 ms later (latency 430 ms) than the LAN. Furthermore, the N400 evoked by the words that followed the target word continued and increased until sentence end. The results are discussed with respect to the hypotheses that the parser constructs distinct syntactic and semantic analyses of a sentence and that this characteristic holds cross-linguistically. The appropriateness of different methodologies to the study of sentence processing is also evaluated.},

In Experiments 2 and 3; cognate primes showed the typical advantage over noncognate primes. However; cognate translation equivalents (phonologically similar translations) showed facilitatory priming; in conditions in which morphologically related primes showed no effect (50-msec prime exposure). Cross-language morphological priming emerged at longer prime exposure durations (66 msec); morphologically related to targets; or phonologically related to targets. In Experiment 1; relative to matched phonologically related primes; the level of phonological overlap across translation equivalents was varied; this cognate advantage disappeared when priming was measured against the phonologically related prime condition.

  abstract = {Near-threshold masked semantic priming of lexical decisions is examined under prime presentation conditions established with several different judgment tasks, using a variety of converging indicators to determine whether subjects can introspect on the prime. In the apparent absence of such awareness, priming effects are found to vary nonmonotonically with stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) between prime and mask. Priming initially decreases as SOA is shortened in the threshold region, but increases as SOA is shortened further. This phenomenon may help to account for discrepancies between studies in which prime presentation conditions were established with different judgment tasks. In addition, priming is influenced by the type of prime information required for successful performance in the judgment task. Facilitation results from related primes relative to unrelated primes after prime presentation conditions have been established with either detection judgments or word discrimination judgments. However, after semantic similarity judgments, related primes produce inhibition. The implication is that different judgment tasks induce different strategies for retrieving information from perceptual encoding mechanisms. These strategies carry over into the priming task, where they influence the operation of encoding mechanisms even when the strategies fail and prime inputs remain unavailable to introspection.},

  abstract = {Masked priming is one of the most important paradigms in the study of visual word recognition, but it is usually thought to require a laboratory setup with a known monitor and keyboard. To test if this technique can be safely used in an online setting, we conducted two online masked priming lexical decision task experiments using PsychoPy/PsychoJS (Peirce et al., 2019). Importantly, we also tested the role of prime exposure duration (33.3 vs.~50 ms in Experiment 1 and 16.7 vs.~33.3 ms in Experiment 2), thus allowing us to examine both across conditions and within-conditions effects. We found that our online data are indeed very similar to the masked priming data previously reported in the masked priming literature. Additionally, we found a clear effect of prime duration, with the priming effect (measured in terms of response time and accuracy) being stronger at 50 ms than 33.3 ms and no priming effect at 16.7 ms prime duration. From these results, we can conclude that modern online browser-based experimental psychophysics packages (e.g., PsychoPy) can present stimuli and collect responses on standard end user devices with enough precision. These findings provide us with confidence that masked priming can be used online, thus allowing us not only to run less time-consuming experiments, but also to reach populations that are difficult to test in a laboratory.},

The available WM capacity was varied by three orthogonal manipulations: (1) syntactic complexity; (2) additional WM load; and (3) verbal WM span. The processing of the morphosyntactic violations was reflected in longer RTs in ungrammatical compared with grammatical sentences, and in an anterior negativity and a centroparietal positivity in the ERPs. While the behavioral grammaticality effect was not influenced by the WM manipulations, the ERP effects were. The amplitude of the anterior negativity was modulated by the combination of complexity and load, and by WM span. The onset of the centroparietal positivity was delayed in the high-load condition, and for the low-span group. ERPs over the course of the sentences showed a frontal negative slow wave under high WM load, largest for the low-span group. The finding that online syntactic processing is related to WM span and to additional WM load does not support the theory that there is a WM capacity specific for syntactic processing.

The modulation of ERPs by WR is influenced by at least 2 processes; one process acts early during the processing of WR, but subsides rapidly as interitem lag between 1st and 2nd presentations increases. The 2nd process occurs later, but is more robust over variations in inter-item lag. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2006 APA, all rights reserved).},

This ability to analyze and interpret an unfamiliar input string raises some important psycholinguistic questions. We are led to ask how this parsing is actually accomplished and what its role is in the recognition of familiar word forms. The Standard psycholinguistic answer to the latter question has been that the human parsing abilities at the lexical level are of only minor importance. Indeed, in modeling lexical processing, psycholinguists have not been particularly concerned with morphological productivity and its implications for lexical processing and storage. This neglect of productivity is clearly apparent in the default view of language comprehension which is assumed to be based upon two radically different processing mechanisms. The first is exploited during word recognition and involves retrieving information from a permanent memory store, the lexicon. The second mechanism allows the integration of the semantic and syntactic information associated with the individually recognized words and their order. These latter processes parse and construct novel sentential representations. Thus, the mechanisms that are capable of generating new linguistic structure are typically reserved for the post-lexical processes.},

A small number of libraries and data centers who see the possibilities of becoming ``digital information management centers'' are taking entrepreneurial steps to extend beyond their traditional information assets and include managing scientific and scholarly research data. The Georgia Institute of Technology (GT) has had a similar development path toward a data curation program based in its library. This paper will articulate GT's program development, which the author offers as an experience common in U.S. universities. The main characteristic is a program devoid of top-level mandates and incentives, but rich with independent, ``bottom-up'' action. The paper will address program antecedents and context, inter-institutional partnerships that advance the library's curation program, library organizational developments, partnerships with campus research communities, and a proposed model for curation program development. It concludes that despite the clear need for data curation put forth by researchers such as the groups of neuroscientists and bioscientists referenced in this paper, the university experience examined suggests that gathering resources for developing data curation programs at the institutional level is proving to be a quite onerous. However, and in spite of the challenges, some U.S. research universities are beginning to establish perceptible data curation programs.},

We used deep neural networks to extract features from 35,326 facial images. These features were entered into a logistic regression aimed at classifying sexual orientation. Given a single facial image, a classifier could correctly distinguish between gay and heterosexual men in 81\% of cases, and in 71\% of cases for women. Human judges achieved much lower accuracy: 61\% for men and 54\% for women. The accuracy of the algorithm increased to 91\% and 83\%, respectively, given five facial images per person. Facial features employed by the classifier included both fixed (e.g., nose shape) and transient facial features (e.g., grooming style). Consistent with the prenatal hormone theory of sexual orientation, gay men and women tended to have gender-atypical facial morphology, expression, and grooming styles. Prediction models aimed at gender alone allowed for detecting gay males with 57\% accuracy and gay females with 58\% accuracy. Those findings advance our understanding of the origins of sexual orientation and the limits of human perception. Additionally, given that companies and governments are increasingly using computer vision algorithms to detect people's intimate traits, our findings expose a threat to the privacy and safety of gay men and women.

Responses of these brain regions are shaped by visual statistical learning. If such learning is compromised, people should be less sensitive to statistically likely feature combinations in words and other objects, and impaired visual word and object recognition should be expected. We therefore tested whether people with dyslexia showed diminished capability for visual statistical learning. Matched dyslexic and typical readers participated in tests of visual statistical learning of pairs of novel shapes that frequently appeared together. Dyslexic readers on average recognized fewer pairs than typical readers, indicating some problems with visual statistical learning. These group differences were not accounted for by differences in intelligence, ability to remember individual shapes, or spatial attention paid to the stimuli, but other attentional problems could play a mediating role. Deficiencies in visual statistical learning may in some cases prevent appropriate experience-driven shaping of neuronal responses in the ventral visual stream, hampering visual word and object recognition.},

This task offers insights into both the timecourse of and individual differences in statistical learning. Experiment 1 charts the micro-level trajectory for statistical learning of nonadjacent dependencies and provides an on-line index of individual differences therein. In Experiment 2, these differences are then shown to predict variations in participants\&\#8217; on-line processing of long-distance dependencies involving center-embedded relative clauses.

In Experiments 1-3 variants of a masked priming lexical-decision task were used; Experiment 4 used a masked priming semantic decision task, and Experiment 5 used a single-word (nonpriming) semantic decision task with a color-boundary manipulation. In addition to the behavioral data, event-related potential (ERP) data were collected in Experiments 1, 2, 4, and 5. Across all experiments, we observed a graded effect of semantic transparency in behavioral and ERP data, with the largest effect for semantically transparent words, the next largest for quasi-transparent words, and the smallest for opaque words.

  abstract = {The mammalian retina \textemdash{} the first component of the visual system \textemdash{} not only transduces light signals into neuronal representations, but also acts as a filter that transfers specific aspects of images to the brain. Movement, colour, fine detail and contrast are processed by different classes of ganglion cell. The underlying circuits are analysed in this article.The first synapse of the retina, the cone pedicle, is the most complex synapse in the CNS. Light signals are transferred here by 500 contacts to a minimum of 10 postsynaptic horizontal and bipolar cells. Horizontal cells regulate the synaptic transmission at the cone pedicle by negative feedback, and bipolar cells transfer the light signals into the inner retina.There are ten different types of bipolar cell, and in the primate retina midget bipolar cells provide a private line from the cones to the midget ganglion cells. They represent the red\textendash green-selective colour channel of the primate retina. Most other bipolar cells transfer a brightness signal to the inner retina.The rod signal is transferred by a special bipolar cell, and is fed into the ON and OFF cone pathway through the AII amacrine cell. This is the most sensitive rod pathway. Recently, other routes of the rod signal through the retina have been discovered.There are at least 10\textendash 15 different morphological types of ganglion cell in any mammalian retina. Their dendritic trees tile the retina without leaving gaps. The brisk-transient (Y)-cells, direction-selective ganglion cells, colour-coded ganglion cells and recently discovered melanopsin-containing ganglion cells are described in detail in the article.Within the inner plexiform layer both the bipolar cell axon terminals and the ganglion cell dendrites stratify at different heights. There they meet specific classes of amacrine cell and different levels of the inner plexiform layer, which represent different neuronal circuits for image analysis.Many tasks in visual processing that have previously been attributed to higher stages of the visual system, such as the visual cortex, take place as early as the mammalian retina.},

  abstract = {Event-related brain potentials were recorded as 18 German-speaking subjects read sentences that contained as critical words German nouns in correct and incorrect plural forms. Two types of plurals were investigated: regular -s plurals (e.g. Karussell-s 'roundabouts') and irregular -(e)n plurals (Muskel-n "muscles'). We compared correct regular and irregular plurals with incorrect ones; the latter had -(e)n on nouns that actually take -s plurals (*Karussell-en), or -s on nouns that require -(e)n (*Muskel-s). ERPs showed different responses to regular and irregular plurals: incorrect irregular plurals (*Muskel-s) elicited a ramp-shaped left frontotemporal negativity, whereas incorrect regulars (*Karussell-en) produced a central phasic negativity with a maximum at 380 ms. This dissociation supports the view that regularly inflected words are processed differently from irregularly inflected ones.},

  abstract = {We examined categorical effects in color appearance in two tasks, which in part differed in the extent to which color naming was explicitly required for the response. In one, we measured the effects of color differences on perceptual grouping for hues that spanned the blue\textendash green boundary, to test whether chromatic differences across the boundary were perceptually exaggerated. This task did not require overt judgments of the perceived colors, and the tendency to group showed only a weak and inconsistent categorical bias. In a second case, we analyzed results from two prior studies of hue scaling of chromatic stimuli (De Valois, De Valois, Switkes, \&amp; Mahon, 1997; Malkoc, Kay, \&amp; Webster, 2005), to test whether color appearance changed more rapidly around the blue\textendash green boundary. In this task observers directly judge the perceived color of the stimuli and these judgments tended to show much stronger categorical effects. The differences between these tasks could arise either because different signals mediate color grouping and color appearance, or because linguistic categories might differentially intrude on the response to color and/or on the perception of color. Our results suggest that the interaction between language and color processing may be highly dependent on the specific task and cognitive demands and strategies of the observer, and also highlight pronounced individual differences in the tendency to exhibit categorical responses.},

Orthographically related primes were formed by removing one letter from the target word, by transposing two adjacent letters, or by replacing two adjacent letters with different letters. Robust masked priming in a lexical decision task was found for primes formed by removing a single letter (e.g., mircle-MIRACLE), and this was not influenced by whether or not the prime contained a letter repetition (e.g., balace vs. balnce as a prime for BALANCE ). Target words containing a repeated letter tended to be harder to respond to than words without a letter repetition, but the nonwords formed by removing a repeated letter (e.g., BALNCE) were no harder to reject than nonwords formed by removing a non-repeated letter (e.g., MIRCLE, BALACE). Significant transposition priming effects were found for 7-Ietter words (e.g., sevrice- SERVICE), and these priming effects did not vary as a function of the position of the transposition (initial, final, or inner letter pair). Priming effects disappeared when primes were formed by replacing the two transposed letters with different letters (e.g., sedlice-SERVICE), and five-letter words only showed priming effects with inner letter transpositions (e.g., ponit-POINT). We present a revised "open-bigram" scheme for letter position coding that accounts for these data. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2005 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract).},

All these theories have in common the distinction between cognitive processes that are fast, automatic, and unconscious and those that are slow, deliberative, and conscious. A number of authors have recently suggested that there may be two architecturally (and evolutionarily) distinct cognitive systems underlying these dual-process accounts. However, it emerges that (a) there are multiple kinds of implicit processes described by different theorists and (b) not all of the proposed attributes of the two kinds of processing can be sensibly mapped on to two systems as currently conceived. It is suggested that while some dual-process theories are concerned with parallel competing processes involving explicit and implicit knowledge systems, others are concerned with the influence of preconscious processes that contextualize and shape deliberative reasoning and decision-making.},

One of the main findings can be characterized as a large cognitive cost, both in terms of speed and accuracy that occurs whenever the reference system used to encode spatial information in memory is not aligned with the reference system required by a particular task. In this paper, the role of aligned and misaligned reference systems is discussed in the context of the built environment and modern architecture. The role of architectural design on the perception and mental representation of space by humans is investigated. The navigability and usability of built space is systematically analysed in the light of cognitive theories of spatial and navigational abilities of humans. It is concluded that a building's navigability and related wayfinding issues can benefit from architectural design that takes into account basic results of spatial cognition research.},

One major issue is whether morphological factors provide an independent principle for lexical organization and processing, or whether morphological effects can be reduced to the joint contribution of form and meaning. The independence of form, meaning, and morphological structure can be directly investigated using derivationally complex words, because derived words can share form but need not share meaning (e.g., archer-arch). We used an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigm to investigate priming between pairs of words that potentially shared a stem, where this link was either semantically transparent (e.g., bravely-brave) or opaque (e.g., archer-arch). These morphologically related pairs were contrasted with identity priming (e.g., mist-mist) and priming for pairs of words that shared only form (e.g., scandal-scan) or meaning (e.g., accuse-blame). Morphologically related words produced significantly reduced activation in left frontal regions, whether the pairs were semantically transparent or opaque. The effect was not found for any of the control conditions (identity, form, or meaning). Morphological effects were observed separately from processing form and meaning and we propose that they reflect segmentation of complex derived words, a process triggered by surface morphological structure of complex words.

This article, however, describes a series of studies (n = 61 undergraduates) that examine a sublexical effect (namely nonlength controlled minimal bigram frequency) that is only found for high frequency words, suggesting that sublexical processing must play a role in the recognition of even high frequency words.

Results from the present reading experiment demonstrate, however, that although both processing aspects elicit a late positivity, they are different in distribution. The repairrelated positivity preceded by a negativity displayed a centroparietal distribution, whereas the complexity-related positivity showed a frontocentral scalp distribution. These data indicate that the P600 is not a unitary phenomenon. Moreover, the distributional differences strongly suggest that different neural structures underlie the two aspects ofprocessing, namely syntactic repair and syntactic integration difficulties, most evident when processing syntactically complex sentences.

The authors used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to suppress the excitability of a portion of left prefrontal cortex and to assess its role in producing nouns and verbs. In one experiment 8 Ss (4 males and 4 females aged 20-29 yrs) generated real words; in a second, 6 Ss (1 male and 5 females aged 18-21 yrs) produced pseudowords as nouns or verbs. In both experiments, response latencies increased for verbs but were unaffected for nouns following rTMS. These results demonstrate that grammatical categories have a neuroanatomical basis and that the left prefrontal cortex is selectively engaged in processing verbs as grammatical objects.

These debates occur across a range of domains and are often difficult to resolve with behavioral data because similar behavioral predictions can be made by models with different core assumptions. Such model mimicry limits researchers' ability to find differential support for one type of model over the other using behavioral data alone. We argue that functional neuroimaging can help overcome this problem by providing additional dependent measures to constrain model testing. Recent advances in analysis, like multivariate approaches, expand the amount and type of data available for model testing. We illustrate the benefits of this approach by highlighting imaging results that directly speak to the debate over the nature of recollection processes in memory. These results show how functional neuroimaging can advance studies of cognition by providing richer data sets for contrasting cognitive models.

  abstract = {Rapid and automatic processing of grammatical complexity is argued to take place during speech comprehension, engaging a left-lateralized fronto-temporal language network. Here we address how neural activity in these regions is modulated by the grammatical properties of spoken words. We used combined magneto- and electroencephalography to delineate the spatiotemporal patterns of activity that support the recognition of morphologically complex words in English with inflectional (-s) and derivational (-er) affixes (e.g., bakes, baker). The mismatch negativity, an index of linguistic memory traces elicited in a passive listening paradigm, was used to examine the neural dynamics elicited by morphologically complex words. Results revealed an initial peak 130\textendash 180 ms after the deviation point with a major source in left superior temporal cortex. The localization of this early activation showed a sensitivity to two grammatical properties of the stimuli: (1) the presence of morphological complexity, with affixed words showing increased left-laterality compared to non-affixed words; and (2) the grammatical category, with affixed verbs showing greater left-lateralization in inferior frontal gyrus compared to affixed nouns (bakes vs. beaks). This automatic brain response was additionally sensitive to semantic coherence (the meaning of the stem vs. the meaning of the whole form) in left middle temporal cortex. These results demonstrate that the spatiotemporal pattern of neural activity in spoken word processing is modulated by the presence of morphological structure, predominantly engaging the left-hemisphere's fronto-temporal language network, and does not require focused attention on the linguistic input.},

  abstract = {Despite a century of research into visual word recognition, basic questions remain unresolved about the functional architecture of the process that maps visual inputs from orthographic analysis onto lexical form and meaning and about the units of analysis in terms of which these processes are conducted. Here we use magnetoencephalography, supported by a masked priming behavioral study, to address these questions using contrasting sets of simple (walk), complex (swimmer), and pseudo-complex (corner) forms. Early analyses of orthographic structure, detectable in bilateral posterior temporal regions within a 150\textendash 230 msec time frame, are shown to segment the visual input into linguistic substrings (words and morphemes) that trigger lexical access in left middle temporal locations from 300 msec. These are primarily feedforward processes and are not initially constrained by lexical-level variables. Lexical constraints become significant from 390 msec, in both simple and complex words, with increased processing of pseudowords and pseudo-complex forms. These results, consistent with morpho-orthographic models based on masked priming data, map out the real-time functional architecture of visual word recognition, establishing basic feedforward processing relationships between orthographic form, morphological structure, and lexical meaning.},

Aspects of that experience, for instance, the frequency of use of certain constructions or particular instances of constructions, have an impact on representation that is evidenced in speaker knowledge of conventionalized phrases and in language variation and change. It is shown that particular instances of constructions can acquire their own pragmatic, semantic, and phonological characteristics. In addition, it is argued that high-frequency instances of constructions undergo grammaticization processes (which produce further change), function as the central members of categories formed by constructions, and retain their old forms longer than lower-frequency instances under the pressure of newer formations. An exemplar model that accommodates both phonological and semantic representation is elaborated to describe the data considered.}

The addition of a morphological (surface code) violation through the wrong form of an article (e.g., a ugly car) decreased reading time but only in cases where that material was deeply processed and where the morphology carried substantial syntactic information (e.g., in German, the definite article carries case, gender, and number information).

This paper reviews what is known about how multimorphemic words are represented in production at lexical and post-lexical stages as well as the influence that lexical properties have on post-lexical processes. A proposal linking these facts together is presented which predicts that post-lexical processes (1) should be weaker when acting across morpheme bundaries and (2) should be influenced by the lexical properties of each morpheme. Post-lexical processing is thus predicted to vary, or be ``heterogeneous'', across a multimorphemic word. Phoneme competition (as indexed by inhibitory effects of phoneme similarity) is compared within and across morphemes in three analyses of oral reading latencies. Competition is found to be weaker across morpheme boundaries, providing support for heterogeneity.},

In any individual research article, several tens of gigabytes-worth of data may be represented\textemdash collected across normal and patient samples. With the ease of collecting such data, there is increased desire for brain imaging datasets to be openly shared through sophisticated databases. However, very often the raw and pre-processed versions of these data are not available to researchers outside of the team that collected them. A range of neuroimaging databasing approaches has streamlined the transmission, storage, and dissemination of data from such brain imaging studies. Though early sociological and technical concerns have been addressed, they have not been ameliorated altogether for many in the field. In this article, we review the progress made in neuroimaging databases, their role in data sharing, data management, potential for the construction of brain atlases, recording data provenance, and value for re-analysis, new publication, and training. We feature the LONI IDA as an example of an archive being used as a source for brain atlas workflow construction, list several instances of other successful uses of image databases, and comment on archive sustainability. Finally, we suggest that, given these developments, now is the time for the neuroimaging community to re-prioritize large-scale databases as a valuable component of brain imaging science.},

Unlike English, Russian makes an obligatory distinction between lighter blues (``goluboy'') and darker blues (``siniy'').

We tested English and Russian speakers in a speeded color discrimination task using blue stimuli that spanned the siniy/goluboy border. We found that Russian speakers were faster to discriminate two colors when they fell into different linguistic categories in Russian (one siniy and the other goluboy) than when they were from the same linguistic category (both siniy or both goluboy). Moreover, this category advantage was eliminated by a verbal, but not a spatial, dual task. These effects were stronger for difficult discriminations (i.e., when the colors were perceptually close) than for easy discriminations (i.e., when the colors were further apart). English speakers tested on the identical stimuli did not show a category advantage in any of the conditions. These results demonstrate that (i) categories in language affect performance on simple perceptual color tasks and (ii) the effect of language is online (and can be disrupted by verbal interference).},

  abstract = {Simple reaction time (SRT), the minimal time needed to respond to a stimulus, is a basic measure of processing speed. SRTs were first measured by Francis Galton in the 19th century, who reported visual SRT latencies below 190 ms in young subjects. However, recent large-scale studies have reported substantially increased SRT latencies that differ markedly in different laboratories, in part due to timing delays introduced by the computer hardware and software used for SRT measurement. We developed a calibrated and temporally precise SRT test to analyze the factors that influence SRT latencies in a paradigm where visual stimuli were presented to the left or right hemifield at varying stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs). Experiment 1 examined a community sample of 1469 subjects ranging in age from 18 to 65. Mean SRT latencies were short (231, 213 ms when corrected for hardware delays) and increased significantly with age (0.55 ms/year), but were unaffected by sex or education. As in previous studies, SRTs were prolonged at shorter SOAs and were slightly faster for stimuli presented in the visual field contralateral to the responding hand. Stimulus detection time (SDT) was estimated by subtracting movement initiation time, measured in a speeded finger tapping test, from SRTs. SDT latencies averaged 131 ms and were unaffected by age. Experiment 2 tested 189 subjects ranging in age from 18 to 82 years in a different laboratory using a larger range of SOAs. Both SRTs and SDTs were slightly prolonged (by 7 ms). SRT latencies increased with age while SDT latencies remained stable. Precise computer-based measurements of SRT latencies show that processing speed is as fast in contemporary populations as in the Victorian era, and that age-related increases in SRT latencies are due primarily to slowed motor output.},

The first two experiments manipulated prime character frequency, orthographic similarity, and SOA (stimulus onset asynchrony)in lexical decision and naming tasks. In the lexical decision task, the target characters which were preceded by an unmasked, orthographically similar prime of higher frequency were responded to slower than their dissimilar pair controls with SOAs of 50 ms and 500 ms. When the SOA duration was extended to 1000 ms in Experiment 2, a significant inhibition effect was observed not only under conditions with primes of higher frequency but also with primes of lower frequency. In Experiment 3, pseudo-character primes were included. It was found that pseudo-character primes obtained no effect upon target recognition while manifesting a small inhibition effect on target naming under the prime exposure duration of 500 ms. In Experiment 4, an additional prime condition of free radicals in isolation was included. It was found in Experiment 4 that with the SOA of 50 ms or 500 ms, the embedded right component radical in isolation facilitated the recognition of the target character embedding it, while not exerting any effect on character naming.

This conversion is the primary source of estrogen to the male brain. It is unclear whether testosterone and estrogen signaling interact to masculinize neural circuits. Using a genetic approach, we show extensive sexual dimorphism in the number and projections of aromatase expressing neurons. The masculinization of these cells is independent of AR but can be induced by either testosterone or estrogen, indicating a role for aromatase in sexual differentiation of these neurons. We provide evidence suggesting that aromatase is also important in activating male aggression and urine marking as these behaviors can be elicited by testosterone in males mutant for AR. Taken together with additional findings, our results suggest that aromatization of testosterone into estrogen is important for the development and activation of neural circuits that control male territorial behaviors.},

Wurm (1997) introduced a construct called the Conditional Root Uniqueness Point (CRUP), which was defined as the uniqueness point of the free root of a prefixed word, given the prefix in question. Prefixed words with free roots can be divided into two mutually exclusive categories: those with the CRUP at the same phoneme as the full-form uniqueness point (UP), and those where the CRUP precedes the full-form UP by one or more phonemes. 89 college students participated in a lexical decision task and 40 college students participated in a naming task. Results of the reaction time (RT) experiments indicate a substantial processing advantage for the latter group of words. Regression analyses revealed effects of the number of auditory competitors a target word had, semantic transparency and prefix likelihood. Finally, semantic transparency, root frequency, and number of competitors had different effects, depending upon whether the CRUP of a word coincided with or preceded the full-form UP. Existing models of word recognition need to be modified to accommodate the current results. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2002 APA, all rights reserved).},

Subjects consistently spotted the change if it occurred while the array moved along a straight path but missed it when it occurred as the array changed direction. This method of inducing change blindness leaves the object in full view during the change; requires no additional distractions, visual occlusion, or global transients; and worked in every subject tested here. This phenomenon joins a body of magic-inspired work that yields insights into perception and attention. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

In a control experiment only the longest prime duration of Exp 1 was used; responses to derived suffixed word targets were facilitated by both free root primes and derived suffixed word primes sharing the target's root (relative to unrelated and form-related control primes). The free root and derived suffixed word prime conditions did not differ significantly. In Exp 2, only true derived word primes produced facilitation, whereas morphologically simple primes containing a pseudoroot did not influence performance relative to the unrelated prime condition.

  abstract = {Which reference is appropriate for the scalp ERP and EEG studies? This unsettled problem still inspires unceasing debate. The ideal reference should be the one with zero or constant potential but unfortunately it is well known that no point on the body fulfills this condition. Consequently, more than ten references are used in the present EEG-ERP studies. This diversity seriously undermines the reproducibility and comparability of results across laboratories. A comprehensive review accompanied by a brief communication with rigorous derivations and notable properties (Hu et al. Brain Topogr, 2019. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10548-019-00706-y) is thus necessary to provide application-oriented principled recommendations. In this paper current popular references are classified into two categories: (1) unipolar references that construct a neutral reference, including both online unipolar references and offline re-references. Examples of unipolar references are the reference electrode standardization technique (REST), average reference (AR), and linked-mastoids/ears reference (LM); (2) non-unipolar references that include the bipolar reference and the Laplacian reference. We show that each reference is derived with a different assumption and serves different aims. We also note from (Hu et al. 2019) that there is a general form for the reference problem, the `no memory' property of the unipolar references, and a unified estimator for the potentials at infinity termed as the regularized REST (rREST) which has more advantageous statistical evidence than AR. A thorough discussion of the advantages and limitations of references is provided with recommendations in the hope to clarify the role of each reference in the ERP and EEG practice.},

The present study extends this earlier work by providing the most comprehensive evaluation to date of semantic richness effects on visual word recognition performance. Specifically, using regression analyses to control for the influence of correlated lexical variables, we considered the impact of contextual dispersion, number of features, number of senses, semantic neighborhood density, imageability, and body-object interaction across five visual word recognition tasks: standard lexical decision, go/no-go lexical decision, speeded pronunciation, semantic classification, and progressive demasking. Semantic richness effects could be reliably detected in all tasks of lexical processing, indicating that semantic representations, particularly their imaginal and featural aspects, play a fundamental role in visual word recognition. However, there was also evidence that the strength of certain richness effects could be flexibly and adaptively modulated by task demands, consistent with an intriguing interplay between task-specific mechanisms and differentiated semantic processing.},

This suggests that the lexical system has access to meaning before a word is fully identified, and is consistent with a theoretical framework based on interactive and cascaded processing. Specifically, semantic richness effects are argued to be produced by feedback from semantic representations to lower-level representations. The present study explores the extent to which richness effects are mediated by feedback from lexical- to letter-level representations. In two lexical decision experiments, we examined the joint effects of stimulus quality and four semantic richness dimensions (imageability, number of features, semantic neighborhood density, semantic diversity). With the exception of semantic diversity, robust additive effects of stimulus quality and richness were observed for the targeted dimensions. Our results suggest that semantic feedback does not typically reach earlier levels of representation in lexical decision, and further reinforces the idea that task context modulates the processing dynamics of early word recognition processes.},

These products include data sets, both small and large, and unique research resources not commercially available, such as cell lines and software programs. The sharing of these resources enhances both the scope and the depth of research, while making more efficient use of time and money. However, sharing is not without costs, many of which are borne by the individual who develops the research resource. Sharing, for example, reduces the uniqueness of the resources available to a scientist, potentially influencing the originator's perceived productivity and ultimately his or her competitiveness for jobs, promotions, and grants. Nevertheless, for most researchers\textemdash particularly those using public funds\textemdash sharing is no longer optional but must be considered an obligation to science, the funding agency, and ultimately society at large. Most funding agencies, journals, and professional societies now require a researcher who has published work involving a unique resource to make that resource available to other investigators. Changes could be implemented to mitigate some of the costs. The creator of the resource could explore the possibility of collaborating with those who request it. In addition, institutions that employ and fund researchers could change their policies and practices to make sharing a more attractive and viable option. For example, when evaluating an individual's productivity, institutions could provide credit for the impact a researcher has had on their field through the provision of their unique resources to other investigators, regardless of whether that impact is reflected in the researcher's list of publications. In addition, increased funding for the development and maintenance of user-friendly public repositories for data and research resources would also help to reduce barriers to sharing by minimizing the time, effort, and funding needed by individual investigators to comply with requests for their unique resource. Indeed, sharing is an imperative, but it is also essential to find ways to protect for both the original owner of the resource and those wishing to share it.},

  abstract = {Young infants can learn statistical regularities and patterns in sequences of events. Studies have demonstrated a relationship between early sequence learning skills and later development of cognitive and language skills. We investigated the relation between infants' visual response speed to novel event sequences, and their later receptive and productive vocabulary. Using a modified visual expectancy paradigm (VExP; Haith, Wentworth, \& Canfield, 1993), we tested 6-month-old infants' speed at responding to novel but predictable contingent event sequences. In addition, parental reports and behavioral measures of infants' vocabulary were obtained at 12, 16, and 22 months. In order to estimate the separate effects of linguistic input on vocabulary, maternal speech from a play session at 12 months was analyzed for lexical diversity and quantity. Results suggest that infants' speed of responding to novel but predictable events at 6 months robustly predicted both receptive and productive vocabulary at 22 months. This relation cannot be attributed to general cognitive maturity, as measured by a standardized test (Bayley Scales of Infant Development; Bayley, 2005). Maternal input predicted additional unique variance in infant processing speed. The results suggest that infants' capacity to quickly learn and respond to sequential patterns, over and above the quality of the speech input they receive, contributes to vocabulary size in the second year.},

Findings from the present study in which 15 Cantonese-speaking and 15 English-speaking Ss (10 agrammatic, 10 fluent non-agrammatic, and 10 non-aphasic) show that agrammatism in Cantonese can be clearly identified from non-aphasic language. Indeed, the disruption patterns of morphological and syntactic structures found in 5 Cantonese-speaking agrammatic Ss were comparable to those demonstrated by a group of matched English-speaking agrammatic Ss. Although the Cantonese agrammatic Ss showed a frequent use of elliptical sentences, they still showed relatively intact ability to choose the structure to form the topic of a sentence. Such an observation was interpreted as an effort of adaptation to compensate for the difficulty in formulating long and complex sentences.

Preliminary cross-linguistic comparisons indicated that morphological awareness in 2 typologically distinct languages, Chinese and English, differs in several major ways. Based on the comparisons, 3 specific hypotheses were formulated: compared with learners with a typologically similar L1 background, Chinese learners of English as an L2 would be less sensitive to intraword structural salience, less efficient in structural analysis, and more adept at integrating word-internal (morphological) and word-external (context) information. These hypotheses were tested empirically with 2 groups of adult L2 learners of English with contrasting L1 backgrounds. 22 native speakers of Chinese and 20 native speakers of Korean participated. Virtually no difference existed between the 2 ESL groups in their intraword structural sensitivity, and although Chinese learners were notably slower than Korean learners in performing intraword structural analysis, they were far more efficient in integrating morphological and contextual information during sentence processing. These findings seem to suggest that Ll processing experience influences the development of L2 morphological awareness in specific and predictable ways.

The more those unconscious habits are explicated and the more we under stand how the disparate characteristics of the various intellectual cultures are related to the necessarily different interests, values, and epistemologies, the more feasible becomes the goal of transcending thought habits. Two sorts of interdisciplinary effort seem to have been successful: specific, delimited problems have been solved by teams in what is actually multidisciplinary rather than interdisciplinary work, and new disciplines have sprung up at the intersections of existing ones. STS fits neither of those patterns. Can it nevertheless be viable?},

This chapter begins with a description of the origins of that framework, focusing on earlier evidence indicating that people of all ages and under a very broad range of circumstances reliably and unintentionally encode information about the relative frequencies of events. Notwithstanding challenges to the automatic encoding view, we believe this empirical generalization remains valid today. Additionally, we describe recent examples of findings from research on language processing and statistical reasoning that add to earlier evidence of the critical contribution of frequency knowledge to cognitive and social functioning. Finally, we note that, in a number of respects, the broader intellectual climate in psychology today is more consistent with our approach to memory encoding than was the intellectual climate of the 1970s.

Simon effects across a variety of conditions, however, are largest for fast responses but decrease, and even reverse, as responses slow. We show in three experiments that these diverging patterns hold within participants and even when the stimulus materials are identical across the tasks. These stable differences in time course serve as bedrock phenomena for building and testing theories of cognitive control and inhibition.

Young children's joint attentional skills then engender some uniquely powerful forms of cultural learning, enabling the acquisition of language, discourse skills, tool-use practices, and other conventional activities. These novel forms of cultural learning allow human beings to, in effect, pool their cognitive resources both contemporaneously and over historical time in ways that are unique in the animal kingdom.},

According to the self-teaching hypothesis, each successful decoding encounter with an unfamiliar word provides an opportunity to acquire word-specific orthographic information that is the foundation of skilled word recognition. Therefore, phonological decoding acts as a self-teaching mechanism or `built-in teacher'. However, all previous connectionist models have learned the task of reading aloud through exposure to a very large corpus of spelling\textendash sound pairs, where an `external' teacher supplies the pronunciation of all words that should be learnt. Such a supervised training regimen is highly implausible. Here, we implement and test the developmentally plausible phonological decoding self-teaching hypothesis in the context of the connectionist dual process model. In a series of simulations, we provide a proof of concept that this mechanism works. The model was able to acquire word-specific orthographic representations for more than 25 000 words even though it started with only a small number of grapheme\textendash phoneme correspondences. We then show how visual and phoneme deficits that are present at the outset of reading development can cause dyslexia in the course of reading development.},

In an auditory lexical decision task, phonological neighborhood (PN) produced the standard inhibitory effect (words with many neighbors produced longer latencies and more errors than words with few neighbors). In contrast, orthographic neighborhood (ON) produced a facilitatory effect. In Experiment 2, the facilitatory ON effect was replicated while controlling for phonotactic probability, a variable that has previously been shown to produce facilitatory effects. In Experiment 3, the results were replicated in a shadowing task, ruling out the possibility that the ON effect results from a strategic and task-specific mechanism that might operate in the lexical decision task. It is argued that the PN effect reflects lexical competition between similar sounding words while the ON effect reflects the consistency of the sublexical mapping between phonology and orthography. The results join an accumulating number of studies suggesting that orthographic information influences auditory word recognition.},

The regular plural -s ending seems to be an exception: Even young children can spell this correctly, even when it is pronounced /z/ (as in bees). Reported here are 3 studies that show that 164 children (aged 5-9 yrs) and 41 adults (aged 18-70 yrs) do not usually base their spellings of plural real-word and pseudo-word endings on the morphological rule that all regular plurals are spelled with -s. Instead, participants appeared to use their knowledge of complex but untaught spelling patterns, which is based on the frequency with which certain letters co-occur in written English.

This technique adds a parametric manipulation of prime duration (or prime intensity) to the traditional design of a fast masked priming study. By doing so, additional information on the time course and nature of priming effects can be obtained. In Exp 1, cross-case letter priming (a-A) was investigated in both alphabetic decision (letter/nonletter classification) and letter naming. In Exp 2, cross-case word priming was investigated in lexical decision and naming. Whereas letter priming in alphabetic decision was most strongly determined by visual overlap between prime and target, word priming in lexical decision was facilitated by both orthographic and phonological information. Orthographic activation was stronger and occurred earlier than phonological activation. In letter and word naming, in contrast, priming effects were most strongly determined by phonological/articulatory information. Differences and similarities between letter and word recognition are discussed in the light of the incremental priming data. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2005 APA, all rights reserved).},

Recent research (Roberson, Davies, \&amp; Davidoff, 2000; Roberson et al., in press) found substantial evidence of cognitive color differences between different language communities, but concerns remained as to how representative might be a tiny, extremely remote community. The present study replicates and extends previous findings using additional paradigms among a larger community in a different visual environment. Adult semi-nomadic tribesmen in Southern Africa carried out similarity judgments, short-term memory and long-term learning tasks. They showed different cognitive organization of color to both English and another language with the five color terms. Moreover, Categorical Perception effects were found to differ even between languages with broadly similar color categories. The results provide further evidence of the tight relationship between language and cognition.},

  abstract = {Vasopressin (VP) and VP-like neuropeptides are evolutionarily stable peptides found in all vertebrate species. In non-mammalian vertebrates, vasotocin (VT) plays a role similar to mammalian VP, whereas mesotocin and isotocin are functionally similar to mammalian oxytocin (OT). Here, we review the involvement of VP in brain circuits, synaptic plasticity, evolution, and function, highlighting the role of VP in social behavior. In all studied species, VP is encoded on chromosome 20p13, and in mammals, VP is produced in specific hypothalamic nuclei and released by the posterior pituitary. The role of VP is mediated by the stimulation of the V1a, V1b, and V2 receptors as well as the oxytocinergic and purinergic receptors. VT and VP functions are usually related to osmotic and cardiovascular homeostasis when acting peripherally. However, these neuropeptides are also critically involved in the central modulation of social behavior displays, such as pairing recognition, pair-bonding, social memory, sexual behavior, parental care, and maternal and aggressive behavior. Evidence suggests that these effects are primarily mediated by V1a receptor in specific brain circuits that provide important information for the onset and control of social behaviors in normal and pathological conditions.},

New simulations based on a greatly simplified, feedforward version of the model (ffCDP+) demonstrate that the models' success in accounting for key phenomena in word naming relies on the nature of its sublexical route. The results with ffCDP+, where the parameter-heavy, interactive lexical route is turned into a simple frequency-weighted activation of lexical phonology, show that the two-layer associative network of phonological assembly is the core component in CDP+ and highlight the intrinsic modularity of the model. Further developments of the model and some directions for future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

The experiments were based on the assumption that 2 orthographically similar words, separated by a short stimulus onset asynchrony, both belong to the same activated set and are therefore competing for recognition. In Exp I, the lexical status of the target was varied, and an inhibitory effect was also found only when targets are words, not when they are pseudowords. An inhibitory effect was also found in Exps II and III for target words of high frequency, whereas with low-frequency target words, either a nonsignificant inhibitory effect or a facilitatory effect was found. Moreover, the effect seemed to vary in relation to the position of the letters shared by prime and target. Results are discussed in terms of an explanation according to which the prime would inhibit the word units of the activated set when these units reach a critical threshold of activation. This threshold would be reached faster by high-frequency words of the set because they start from a higher resting level. An alternative explanation consistent with the verification model is taken into account. (20 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Notwithstanding, nonhuman primates are remarkably unskillful at controlling vocal production and at combining basic call units into more complex strings. Instead, their vocal behavior is linked to specific psychological states, which are evoked by events in their social or physical environment. Humans are the only primates that have evolved the ability to produce elaborate and willfully controlled vocal signals, although this may have been a fairly recent invention. Despite their expressive limitations, nonhuman primates have demonstrated a surprising degree of cognitive complexity when responding to other individuals' vocalizations, suggesting that, as recipients, crucial linguistic abilities are part of primate cognition. Pivotal aspects of language comprehension, particularly the ability to process semantic content, may thus be part of our primate heritage. The strongest evidence currently comes from Old World monkeys, but recent work indicates that these capacities may also be present in our closest relatives, the chimpanzees.},

Given this, one might expect morphological complexity to modulate early visual evoked activity in electromagnetic measures. We investigated the neural bases of morphological decomposition with magnetoencephalography (MEG). In two experiments, we manipulated morphological complexity in single word lexical decision without priming, once using suffixed words and once using prefixed words. We found that morphologically complex forms display larger amplitudes in the M170, the same component that has been implicated for letterstring and face effects in previous MEG studies. Although letterstring effects have been reported to be left-lateral, we found a right-lateral effect of morphological complexity, suggesting that both hemispheres may be involved in early analysis of word forms.},

One goal of the study was to replicate and expand upon findings suggesting facilitative effects of morphological relatives of a target word. A second goal was to demonstrate the need for a reinterpretation of root and surface frequency effects, which traditionally have been taken as indicators of parsing-based and memory-driven processing, respectively. In a first study, we used the same stimuli across auditory and visual lexical decision and naming. Mixed-effects statistical modeling revealed that surface frequency was a robust predictor of RTs even in the very low end of the distribution, but root frequency was not. Also, the nature of the similarity between a target and its lexical competitors is crucial. Measures gauging the influence of morphological relatives of the target were facilitative, while measures gauging the influence of words related only in form were inhibitory. A second study analyzing data from the English Lexicon Project, for a large sample of words from across the full frequency range, supports these conclusions. An information-theoretical analysis of root and surface frequency explains why surface frequency must be the most important predictor, with only a marginal role for root frequency.},

Spoken sentences served as primes to visual target words, presented for lexical decision. Targets were either simple verbs (e.g., brengen, bring) or particle verbs, consisting of a simple verb plus a separable prefix (e.g., meebrengen, bring along). Particle verbs were either semantically transparent or opaque. Transparent particle verbs are semantically related to their constituent verb (e.g., meebrengen, bring along), opaque verbs are not (e.g., ombrengen, exterminate). In Experiment 1, facilitation was consistently obtained when verb targets were semantically congruent with the content of the sentence primes. But priming was also found in incongruent conditions, when opaque verbs served as targets with sentences constructed to prime the meaning of their embedded verbs. Post-hoc analyses and data from Experiment 2, however, showed that this was due to the ambiguous nature of some opaque particle verbs. Whereas the dominant opaque and the subordinate transparent meaning of ambiguous particle verbs could both be primed, truly opaque verbs were not facilitated by the semantic field of their constituent verbs. Given abundant evidence for a close association, at a morphological level, of transparent and opaque complex words to their constituents, the data demonstrate a dissociation between connections at lexical and conceptual levels of representation.

The QRTEngine can be used to easily develop browser-based online reaction time experiments with accurate timing within current browser capabilities, and it requires only minimal programming skills. After introducing the QRTEngine, we briefly discuss how to create and distribute a Stroop task. Next, we describe a study in which we investigated the timing accuracy of the engine under different processor loads using external chronometry. Finally, we show that the QRTEngine can be used to reproduce classic behavioral effects in three reaction time paradigms: a Stroop task, an attentional blink task, and a masked-priming task. These findings demonstrate that QRTEngine can be used as a tool for conducting online behavioral research even when this requires accurate stimulus presentation times.},
